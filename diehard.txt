                         "DIE EASY"

     405 FREEWAY - LOS ANGELES - EARLY EVENING

     Christmas tinsel on the light poles.  We ARE LOOKING east
     past Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when
     suddenly we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 --
     the noise is deafening.

     INT. 747 - PASSENGERS - SAME

     The usual moment just after landing when you let out that
     sigh of relief that you've made it in one piece.  As the
     plane TAXIS to its gate, they stir, gather personal
     belongings.

     ON JOHN MCCLANE mid-thirties, good-looking, athletic and
     tired from his trip.  He sits by the window.  His relief on
     landing is subtle, but we NOTICE.  Suddenly, he hears --

                           SALESMAN'S VOICE
               You don't like flying, do you?

     McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.  Caught,
     he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear.

                           MCCLANE
               No, no, where'd you get that idea?

                           SALESMAN
                    (smiling)
               Ya wanna know the secret of successful
               air travel?  After you get where
               you're going, ya take off your shoes
               and socks.
               Then ya walk around on the rug
               barefoot and make fists with your
               toes.

                           MCCLANE
               Fists with your toes.

                           SALESMAN
               Maybe it's not a fist when it's your
               toes...I mean like this...work out
               that time zone tension.
                    (demonstrating)
               Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot
               shower for the old jet lag.  I know
               it sounds crazy.  Trust me.  I've
               been doing it for nine years.

     The plane stops.  Passengers rise, start to take down overhead
     luggage.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     McClane does this, but as he opens the door above, the
     businessman BLANCHES seeing:

     HIS P.O.V. - MCCLANE'S BARETTA PISTOL

     Peeking out from his jacket.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Recognizing the look, McClane smiles reassuringly.

                           MCCLANE
               It's okay.
                    (showing badge)
               I'm a cop.
                    (pause)
               Trust me.  I've been doing it for
               eleven.

     The businessman relaxes, moves off.  McClane now wrestles
     down the biggest Teddy Bear FAO Schwartz had to offer.
     Balancing this, he moves down to another overhead, takes out
     a topcoat and an overnighter.  Barely managing all this, he
     turns,

     COLLIDING WITH:

     A PRETTY STEWARDESS

     She bumps noses with the bear, gives a look.

                           STEWARDESS
                    (smiling, about the
                    bear)
               Maybe you should have bought her a
               ticket.

                           MCCLANE
               Her?

     He scrutinizes the nether regions of the bear, shrugs.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               She doesn't complain.

                           STEWARDESS
                    (eying him)
               Neither would I.

     McClane smiles, with just enough of a sigh to know he's as
     wistful about things-that-might-have-been as she is...moves
     down the aisle.

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. THE NAKATOMI BUILDING (LOS ANGELES) - EVENING

     CLOSE ON A bottle of Dom Perignon as the cork explodes across
     a large office floor decorated for Christmas.  A Japanese
     man, mid-fifties standing on a desk holds up the bottle
     triumphantly and looks out at an adoring audience of junior
     executives and office personnel.  He is JOSEPH TAKAGI, Sr
     V.P. of Sales for Nakatomi, a multinational corporation.

                           TAKAGI
               Ladies and gentlemen...I congratulate
               each and every one of you for making
               this one of the greatest days in the
               history of the Nakatomi corporation...

     In the b.g., obviously still at work, an attractive
     BUSINESSWOMAN in her mid-thirties, studying a computer
     printout, heads toward her office.  Falling into step with
     her is HARRY ELLIS, thirty-seven, V.P. of Sales.  Well-
     dressed, with stylish, slicked-back hair, he looks and acts
     very smooth.

                           ELLIS
               What about dinner?

                           WOMAN (HOLLY)
               Harry, it's Christmas Eve.
               Families...stockings...chestnuts...R
               udolph and Frosty...those things
               ring a bell?

     She turns into:

     HER OFFICE

     Her name is HOLLY GENNARO MCCLANE, though the nameplate on
     her door stops after the first two.  She puts the printout
     down on her secretary's desk.

                           ELLIS
                    (in reply)
               I was thinking more of roaring
               fireplaces...mulled wine and a nice
               brie...

     Holly ignores the come-on, turns to her secretary.

                           HOLLY
               Ginny, it's 6:40, you're making me
               feel like Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Go on,
               join the party, have some champagne.

     Ginny slowly manipulates herself out of her seat.  She is
     enormously pregnant.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           GINNY
                    (grateful)
               Thanks Ms. Gennaro.
                    (worried)
               Do you think the baby can handle a
               little sip?

                           HOLLY
                    (eyeing her)
               Ginny, that baby's ready to tend
               bar.

                           ELLIS
                    (not giving up)
               How about tomorrow night?

     Holly just points to the door.  He follows Ginny out, clearly
     not giving up.  Just then the party on Holly's phone picks
     up and we:

     INTERCUT:

     INT. NICE HOUSE IN SANTA MONICA

     where a five-year old LUCY MCCLANE races her YOUNGER BROTHER
     to the phone, wins the wrestling match, and answers with a
     sense of importance.  An Xmas tree is in the b.g.

                           LUCY
               McClane residence.  Lucy McClane
               speaking.

     Holly suddenly smiles.  It is the first time we've seen her
     smile and it speaks volumes about the person hidden under a
     tough business exterior.

                           HOLLY
                    (with affection)
               Hello, Lucy McClane.  This is your
               mother.

     She looks up and watches Ellis leave.  He "shoots" her with
     a "catch ya later" wink.

                           LUCY
               Mommy!  When are you coming home?!

                           HOLLY
               Soon.  You'll be in bed when I get
               there, though.

                           LUCY
               Will you come say 'good night'?

                           HOLLY
               Don't I always, you goose?
                    (enjoying Lucy's giggle)
               Now put Paulina on the line, and no
               searching the house for presents!

                           LUCY
                    (caught)
               I didn't look in the front closet
               under the steps!  Is Daddy coming
               home with you?

                           JOHN, JR.
                    (hearing this, jumping
                    up and down)
               Yeah!  Daddy!  Daddy!  Daddy!
                    (on second thought)
               And a Captain Power!

                           HOLLY
                    (a little tightly)
               Well, we'll see what Santa and Mommy
               can do.  Goose, put Paulina on, okay?

     Lucy hands the phone to a young Salvadorian woman, PAULINA,
     the housekeeper.

                           PAULINA
               Hello, Mrs. Holly.  You coming home
               soon?

                           HOLLY
               I'm working on it.
                    (beat)
               Did Mr. McClane call?*

                           PAULINA
               No ma'am.

     Holly hides a trace of disappointment.

                           HOLLY
               Well...maybe there wasn't time before*
               the flight.  You should probably
               make up the spare room just in case.

                           PAULINA
                    (smiling)
               Yes, Mrs. Holly.  I do that already.

     Holly's smile comes through again.

     INT. LAX - EVENING

     McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest
     stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,
     comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.

     He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal,
     an act which drives him into another fender bender with a
     CUTE GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.
     As she smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic
     gear and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed
     boyfriend.

                           MCCLANE
                    (sotto, to himself)
               California.

     He looks around the terminal at:

     HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL

     FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents
     greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet
     uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant
     wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very
     touching and not the least bit corny.

     BACK TO SCENE

     McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the
     waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.

     Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an
     ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a
     rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE
     written on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of
     him, unsure.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               I'm John McClane.

                           ARGYLE
                    (introducing himself)
               Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,
               nice bag.

     He turns and starts walking.  McClane paces him, still
     juggling bag and giant animal.

                           MCCLANE
               Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?

                           ARGYLE
                    (stops)
               Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have
               to help me, man.  This is my first
               time driving a limo.

                           MCCLANE
               That's okay.  This is my first time
               riding in one.

                                                          CUT TO:

     WITH THE LIMO - DUSK

     TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.  Both Argyle and
     McClane are in the front seat.

                           ARGYLE
               Just kick back and relax, man.  We
               got everything you need:  CD, CB,
               TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.

     He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.

                           ARGYLE (CONT'D)
               If your friend is hot to trot...I
               know a couple of mama bears.
                    (turning to McClane)
               ...Or is he married?

                           MCCLANE
               Married.

     McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE
     reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at
     Argyle.

                           ARGYLE
               The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't
               expect you to sit up front.
                    (back to the topic)
               So, your lady live out here?

                           MCCLANE
               The past six months.

                           ARGYLE
                    (thinking about that)
               Meanwhile, you still live in New
               York?

                           MCCLANE
               You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?

                           ARGYLE
               Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a
               cabdriver, see, people expected a
               little chit chat, a little
               eccentricity and camaraderie, I forgot
               how stuck up you limo guys were, so
               excuse me.

                           MCCLANE
                    (amused)
               It's okay, it's okay.

                           ARGYLE
                    (instantly)
               So, you divorced or what?

     McClane gives up.

                           MCCLANE
               She had a good job, it turned into a
               great career.

                           ARGYLE
               But meant her moving here.

                           MCCLANE
               Closer to Japan.  You're fast.

                           ARGYLE
               So, why didn't you come?

                           MCCLANE
               'Cause I'm a New York cop who used
               to be a New York kid, and I got six
               months backlog of New York scumbags
               I'm still trying to put behind bars.
               I don't just get up and move.

                           ARGYLE
                    (to the point)
               You mean you thought she wouldn't
               make it out here and she'd come
               crawling on back, so why bother to
               pack?

     McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.

                           MCCLANE
               Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.

                           ARGYLE
                    (popping in a cassette)
               Mind if I play some tunes?

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.

                           MCCLANE
               How 'bout some Christmas music?

                           ARGYLE
               That is Christmas music.

     And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys or Run DMC doing a
     revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane
     gives up, looks out the window.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats,
     Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees
     trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token
     "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style
     has its own unique style.

     THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY

     TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,
     impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo
     pulls up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself
     out, which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's
     supposed to do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.

     EXT. NAKATOMI BUILDING - NIGHT

     Argyle climbs out of the limo and stops by the trunk.

                           ARGYLE
               So, you go on upstairs to the party,
               your lady sees you, you run into
               each other's arms.  Music comes up,
               you live happily ever after, that
               it?

                           MCCLANE
               It's corny, but I could live with
               it.

                           ARGYLE
               What is it don't work out that way?
               Where you gonna stay?

                           MCCLANE
               I'll find someplace.

     He looks up at the highrise lit by huge spotlights, then
     back at Argyle who's made no attempt to open the trunk.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           ARGYLE
               Tell you what.  I'll pull into the
               parking garage and wait.  You score
               with your wife give me a call on the
               car phone and I'll leave your bags
               inside at the desk.  You strike out...
               I'll get you to a hotel.

     He hands McClane a business card with the number on it.

                           MCCLANE
                    (taking the number)
               You're all right, Argyle.

                           ARGYLE
               Just remember that when you sign for
               the tip.
                    (pointing to the
                    building)
               They're paying for it, so don't be
               shy.

     McClane grins, heads inside.

     INT. NAKATOMI LOBBY - NIGHT

     Beautiful and -- on first glance -- deserted.  Finally a
     SOUND in the sterile lobby reveals the presence of a SECURITY
     GUARD hidden until now behind a massive desk.

     McClane goes there, signs in.

                           MCCLANE
               Holly McClane?

     The Guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console.

                           GUARD
               Just type it in there.

     McClane is confused for a moment, then he moves to the screen.

     He gives the Guard a look...the Guard raises his eyebrows as
     if to say give it a try.

     SCREEN - CLOSER

     McClane types, "McClane, Holly".  Pause.  The screen replies,
     NO SUCH EMPLOYEE LISTED.

     MCCLANE

     Frowns...thinks.  Simultaneously inspired and suspicious, he
     types again.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     THE SCREEN

     McClane types, GENNERO, HOLLY.  This time the screen CHANGES,
     shows an elevation of the building and then a floor plan of
     the 30th floor with Holly's office BLINKING.*

     BACK TO SCENE

                           MCCLANE
               Cute toy.

                           GUARD
               Yeah.  When you have to take a leak
               it'll help you find your zipper.

                           MCCLANE
               Thirtieth floor...*

                           GUARD
                    (pointing)
               Take the express elevator and get
               off at the noise.

     McClane nods, moves off.  He moves to the elevators, and as
     he does his experienced eye takes in:

     ANOTHER SECURITY GUARD

     Patrolling a different area.

     SEVERAL HI-TECH CAMERAS AND SENSORS

     which are cleverly worked into the decor of the lobby.

     BACK TO SCENE

     McClane reacts with bored professionalism, NODS to the guard.

                           MCCLANE
               Lots of hardware...

     The guard shrugs.  McClane gets in the elevator.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     McClane hits "30" and REACTS to the hyper-powered SPEED with
     which he rises.  He rotates his head, getting out the travel
     cricks.

     As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING,
     THROBBING NOISE.  McClane stops and listens before he realizes --
     it's the party.  As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     30TH FLOOR - SAME

     McClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually
     spiraling inward.  He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch
     from a passing tray, sips...scowls.  Spotting open beers in
     an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even
     burying the plastic glass.  Sipping the beer, he moves through
     the dense party.  People he doesn't know throw streamers
     over him.

     A WOMAN kisses him.  He grins.  A MAN kisses him.

                           MCCLANE
                    (to himself, shaking
                    his head)
               California...

     Finally he queries a DANCING WOMAN.  The MUSIC drowns out
     their words but she nods, points off in some generic
     direction.

     McClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses
     his bearings.  He sees:

     TAKAGI

     who has an air of authority.  McClane goes up to him.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               Excuse me, I'm looking for --

                           TAKAGI
               Holly Gennero?

                           MCCLANE
               Yeah.  How'd you know?

                           TAKAGI
               I've spent half my life on airplanes,
               I can recognize someone who just got
               off one.
                    (shaking hands)
               I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have
               ...something to do with this company.

                           MCCLANE
               So I've heard.

     Takagi smiles, leads the way.  As they approach Holly's office
     door, McClane notices the name there is -- again -- "Gennero".

                           TAKAGI
               Holly went to the Vault room to FAX
               some documents...she should be back
               any...

     HOLLY'S OFFICE

     Ellis is behind the desk.  He's SNIFFLING and just as they
     come in he SWEEPS the back of the slick desktop with his
     hand.

     Both McClane and Takagi catch on...but Takagi tries to hide
     his awareness.

                           ELLIS
               Ah...hi...I just had to make a quick
               call, and this was the nearest
               phone...

                           TAKAGI
                    (as Ellis rises)
               Ellis, this is John McClane...
                    (with meaning)
               Holly's policeman?
                    (to McClane)
               Ellis is in charge of International
               Acquisitions.

                           MCCLANE
                    (shaking hands with
                    Ellis)
               That explains the recent deal with
               Bolivia.

     Ellis REACTS, runs a checking finger under his nose.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
                    (sotto)
               Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.

                           TAKAGI
                    (eager to change the
                    subject, to McClane)
               Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake?
               Watered down champagne punch?

                           MCCLANE
                    (grinning)
               I'm fine.
                    (looking through the
                    glass)
               You throw quite a party.  I didn't
               know they had Christmas in Japan.

                           TAKAGI
               Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor
               didn't work out, we got you with
               tape decks.

     McClane laughs.  He likes this guy.

                           ELLIS
               Actually, it's kind of a double
               celebration.  We closed a pretty big
               deal today and a lot of it was due
               to Holly.

     The door OPENS.  Holly comes inside.

                           HOLLY
               All set, Joe.  The contracts went
               over the wire, and --
                    (surprised)
               John...!

     MCCLANE AND HOLLY

     A moment.  Does the sound of the party stop for him?  We
     know it.  For her?  It's more cryptic.  We sure hope so.

                           HOLLY
                    (recovering)
               I was hoping you made that flight.

                           JOHN
                    (quietly)
               I was hoping you were hoping that.

     She laughs, kisses him on the cheek.  Ellis notes the
     awkwardness.

                           TAKAGI
                    (to McClane)
               You wife's made for this business.

     She know how to drive a hard bargain.

                           MCCLANE
               Yeah.  I remember our first date.

                           ELLIS
               Show him the watch.

     AS SHE HESITATES:

                           ELLIS (CONT'D)
               Go on, show him.
                           (MORE)

                           ELLIS (CONT'D)
               What're you, embarrassed?
                    (to McClane)
               A little token of our appreciation
               for all her work.

     He takes Holly's wrist, holds it up.  McClane smoothly takes
     the wrist away from Ellis, looks at the watch.

                           MCCLANE
               Nice, but one of us is three hours
               out of sync.  I think it's me.
                    (to Holly, pointedly)
               Is there a place I can wash up?

                           HOLLY
                    (happy for the excuse)
               Sure.  Follow me.

     They go out.  Alone, Takagi's look at Ellis shows his
     disapproval of certain snow at Christmas.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. NAKATOMI - NIGHT

     An Emory freight truck turns off Olympic into the underground
     parking garage of Nakatomi.

     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     It goes down the ramp and passes Argyle's black limo.  The
     driver's seat is EMPTY.

     INT. LIMO - SAME

     Argyle sits in the back seat hidden from the outside world
     by the tinted rear windows.  He is making a drink from the
     bar with the TV on and his rap music blasting from the
     cassette player, oblivious to the truck passing behind him.

     INT. PARKING GARAGE - SAME

     The Emory truck stops in front of the service elevator on
     the next level down.  As the truck idles, the uniformed driver
     makes a note on his clipboard.

     INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT

     TILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET.  He is clenching and
     unclenching his toes.

                           MCCLANE
                    (surprised, actually
                    feeling tension
                    decline)
               Son-of-a-bitch.  It works.

     Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket,
     tie shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.

                           HOLLY
               What are you doing?

                           MCCLANE
               It's a long story.  You know, I think
               that Ellis has his eye on you.

                           HOLLY
               That's okay...
                    (pause)
               ... I have an eye on his private
               bathroom.

     McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not
     to show any).

                           HOLLY (CONT'D)
               So, where are you staying?  This all
               happened so fast I didn't even ask
               you on the phone.

     McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath
     doorway.

                           MCCLANE
               Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here
               a couple years ago.  He said I could
               bunk with him.

                           HOLLY
               Oh...Where does he live?

                           MCCLANE
               Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.

                           HOLLY
               Pomona!  You'll be in the car the
               whole time...Look, let's make this
               easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's
               not huge, but the kids would love to
               have you at the house.

     McClane fixes her with a look.

                           MCCLANE
               They would, huh?

                           HOLLY
                    (beat; honest)
               I would too.

     They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that
     says a lot about how they still feel about each other.

     Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the
     door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty
     retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly
     tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.

                           HOLLY (CONT'D)
               ...I've missed you.

                           MCCLANE
               Especially my name.  You must miss
               it every time you write a check.
               When did you start calling yourself
               'Ms. Gennero'?

                           HOLLY
                    (caught)
               This is a Japanese company, you know?
               They figure a married woman, she's
               on the way out the door...

                           MCCLANE
               Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember
               this one particular married woman,
               she went out the door so fast there
               was practically a jetwash...I mean,
               talk about your wind chill factor...

                           HOLLY
               Didn't we have this same conversation
               in July?  Damn it, John, there was
               an opportunity out here -- I had to
               take it --

                           MCCLANE
               No matter what it did to our marriage-?

                           HOLLY
               My job and my title and my salary
               did nothing to our marriage except
               change your idea of what it should
               be.

                           MCCLANE
               Oh, here it comes.  One of those
               'meaningful relationship
               conversations.' I never should've
               let you get those magazine
               subscriptions --

                           HOLLY
               You want to know my idea of a
               marriage?  It's a partnership where
               people help each other over the rough
               spots --console each other when
               there's a down...and when there's an
               up, well, hell, a little Goddamn
               applause or an attaboy wouldn't be
               too bad.
                    (quietly)
               I needed that, John.
                    (Pause)
               I deserved that.

     There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to
     say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.  Just
     then the door opens and Ginny leans inside.

                           GINNY
               Miz Gennero?  Mr. Takagi is looking
               for you...he wants you to say
               something to the troops...

                           HOLLY
               Thanks, Ginny.  I'll be a second.
               Oh, this is --

                           MCCLANE
                    (mock bright 'radio'
                    voice)
               Hi.  John Gennero here.  I'm the
               sensitive and supportive man of the
               eighties.

     Ginny looks puzzled, goes out.  Holly sighs, moves to the
     door.

                           HOLLY
               I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --

                           MCCLANE
               Don't I always?

     She's gone.  Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.

     INT. BUILDING LOBBY - SAME TIME

     The Guard at the front desk notices the Emory truck on his
     monitor.  The Guard continues to watch the Emory truck and
     only half notices as a Mercedes pulls up in front of the
     building and two extremely well-dressed BUSINESSMAN (late
     twenties) climb out and start up the stairs for the door.
     As they cross the lobby to the Guard's table to sign in, we
     hear their conversation.

                           MAN #1 (THEO)
                    (animatedly)
               ...So, Kareem rebounds -- listen,
               this is a great play -- feeds Worthy
               on the break, over to A.C., to Magic,
               back to Worthy in the lane and --

     Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a
     silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.  Before the
     Guard can react he pulls the trigger.

                           THEO
                    (dryly)
               Boom...two points.

     (The speed with which the murder takes place sets the tone
     for the rest of the action.)  The killer moves behind the
     desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.

     His name is KYLE, big, with long blond hair like a rock
     drummer.  Karl takes off the silencer and looks at the video
     monitor of the Emory truck.  The first man, Theo, opens his
     briefcase, takes out a portable CB radio and speaks into it.

                           THEO (CONT'D)
               We're in.

     ON THE SCREEN

     The driver nods at the security camera as several men climb
     out of the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates
     by the service elevator.

     INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT

     McClane looks at all the lavishness around him and picks up
     a phone by the toilet.  He opens his wallet and takes out
     the phone number Argyle gave him.  A photo of his children
     stops him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     It's of Holly, the two children and himself in happier days:

     Six months ago, before Nakatomi came calling to Holly's door.

     McClane flips it over.  On the back in crude but painstaking
     hand of a five-year-old it says:  WE MISS YOU, DADDY.  LOVE
     LUCY (and in more primitive letters) JOHN.

     McClane returns the photo to his wallet, dials the number.

     INT. BUILDING OPERATIONS CONTROL ROOM

     Theo enters the small control room and comfortably sits behind
     a maintenance keyboard.  Whistling a vaguely familiar tune,
     he TYPES in some commands and locks down the passenger
     elevators up to the 30th floor.  Then with several more
     computer commands, systematically causes:

     THE HEAVY STEEL GATES TO THE PARKING GARAGE CLOSE

     THE ESCALATORS TO THE GARAGE COME TO A STOP

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     Theo finishes typing and disconnects the keyboard and pulls
     out the wires from beneath the panel.

     INT. LOBBY - SAME

     The doors to a service elevator open TO REVEAL HANS GRUBER,
     impeccably dressed, lean and handsome, he steps out into the
     lobby like he owns the building -- and in a way he does.

     Theo steps to the door of the control room and tosses Hans a
     COMPUTER CARD.

     Hans goes to the front door, waves the card over a magnetic
     plate.  An LED BLINKS and the door LOCKS with a THUD.

     Hans looks out at the street.  Appropriately enough, "not a
     creature is stirring."  Century City is quiet.

     LOBBY - QUICK CUTS

     An elevator opens REVEALING TEN MORE MEN, all armed with
     Kalashnikov machine guns and carrying canvas kit bags.  One
     of them, EDDIE, a rugged American in his twenties, goes to
     the dead guard and immediately begins changing into his
     cloths.

     MEANWHILE:

     A)  Karl takes a tool case from the elevator and joins his
     brother TONY, first playfully grabbing him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     They head for the basement stairwell;

     B)  Theo leaves the control room and nods to Hans.

     C)  Eddie finished adjusting buttons and snaps on his pilfered
     uniform, takes his position behind the front desk.

     HANS

     looks at his watch and seems pleased.  He steps into the
     service elevator with the others and presses the button for
     the 30th floor.  The entire sequence has taken maybe sixty
     seconds.

     INT. ELLIS' BATHROOM - 30TH FLOOR - SAME

     McClane is still barefoot, his pant legs now rolled up above
     his ankles.  He stretches his toes again.  Damn, it works.
     He lights up a new Marlboro, dials a number on the (bathroom)
     phone.

     INT. BUILDING BASEMENT - PHONE ROOM

     A large sign says:  PACIFIC BELL EMPLOYEES ONLY.  Inside
     Tony stands in front of an intimidating matrix of phone lines --
     but what he has in mind won't require a doctorate in
     Electrical Engineering.  Karl comes over, gives his an elder
     brother's punch on the arm, points out what to do.  Together
     they focus on four CPV plastic conduits which run out of the
     main panel over their heads.  Tony nods.  Opens a case
     REVEALING a compact electric chainsaw.

     INT. ELLIS' BATHROOM - RESUME

                           MCCLANE
                    (on phone)
               Argyle...?

     INT. LIMO

     Argyle is reclining on the seat.  The music is on so loud
     that it is nearly impossible to hear.

                           ARGYLE
               Hey, John, what's the word on you
               and your lady?

                           MCCLANE'S VOICE
               The vote's not in yet.

     INT. PHONE ROOM - SAME

     Karl cuts through the four tubes one at a time.

     INT. ELLIS' BATHROOM - SAME

     McClane on the phone.

                           ARGYLE'S VOICE
                    (mocking)
               'Vote's not in yet?'  What's that
               supposed to mean.

                           MCCLANE
               What do you want, 'All My Children'?
               We're making progress.  After I get
               my foot out of my mouth, we'll really
               be cooking, and then I can --

     He stops and gently taps the phone cradle.  No dial tone.

     INT. LIMO

     Argyle looks at the phone.

                           ARGYLE
               What?...Mr. Mac, you there?

     He turns down the music but there is on one on the line.

                           ARGYLE (CONT'D)
                    (to himself)
               Well, call me back, John.  You got
               the number.

     He hangs up and turns the volume back up.

     ELLIS' OFFICE

     McClane hangs up the original phone and then tries the other
     one on the desk.  It, too, is dead.

     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR

     Hans and the others approaching the 30th floor.  As they
     grow closer, we hear the noise of the speakers growing louder
     and louder.  The men cock their weapons and brace themselves
     as the car stops and the elevator doors open.  ON THE SOUND
     OF GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMS WE:

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. ELLIS' OFFICE

     McClane grabs his shoulder harness off the back of the chair,
     moves quickly to the doorway.  He looks down the hall.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     MCCLANE'S P.O.V.

     Two terrorists, FRANCO and FRITZ, armed with M-5 machine
     guns searching the offices on the hall one by one.  They
     open a door, look in from the hallway, and move on quickly
     to the next.

     They are four offices away and moving fast.

     McClane looks across the corridor and sees the stairwell
     door

     -- too far to reach without being seen.

     MCCLANE

     steps back, throws off the safety on his Beretta and braces
     himself.  He opens the door, peers through a crack at:

     HALLWAY - FRANCO AND FRITZ

     QUICK CUTS as McClane's eyes SCAN their weapons...he's totally
     outgunned, and he knows it.

     Franco and Fritz reach the office just before Ellis' and
     throw open the door REVEALING the man and woman who
     interrupted Holly and McClane a few minutes before, now in
     the throes of passionate lovemaking on the desk.  The two
     terrorists smile at each other, then enter the office.

     A moment later the man, (trying desperately to pull up his
     pants) and the woman (buttoning her blouse) are pushed out
     into the hall and toward the larger group by Fritz.  The
     other terrorist, Franco, goes to Ellis' office and opens the
     door.

     It is...empty.

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     CLOSE ON McClane's bare feet padding quickly up the concrete
     stairs, two at a time.  We FOLLOW him up, then out onto the:

     31ST FLOOR

     This is the mezzanine floor immediately above the main
     Nakatomi lobby.  McClane sees Theo and KRISTOFF wheeling
     carts of equipment.  McClane ducks back into the stairwell,
     he runs

     up another flight and out onto:

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     UNFINISHED FLOOR

     Eventually it will be one large secretarial pool, but only a
     portion is completed.  Half-finished partitions and office
     furniture in its original plastic wrappings are everywhere.

     One end has a few lonely finished working areas.

     McClane moves quickly to a desk and picks up a phone.  It's
     out.

                           MCCLANE
               Shit...

     HE LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW AT:

     NEIGHBORING BUILDING - MCCLANE'S P.O.V.

     A high-rise apartment building a half-block away sparkles
     with lights.  McClane stares at a PRETTY GIRL in her bedroom.
     She's wearing drop dead underwear right out of the Victoria's
     Secret catalog.  As we watch, she flops down on her bed, and
     with one long leg in the air, effortlessly dials a call on
     her high-tech phone.  It seems so easy.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Frustrated, he watches this, knits his brow.

                           MCCLANE
               Think...

     INT. 30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME

     The employees have been herded to the center of the room
     where the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are
     whimpering.

     HOLLY

     She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on
     this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.

     Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her
     mettle.

     WIDER

     As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.

     He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her
     hand "reassuringly."

     Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He
     reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he
     comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks
     his own scribblings like a dais speaker.

                           HANS
                    (soothing, in control)
               Ladies and gentlemen, due to the
               Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of
               greed around the globe, it is about
               to be taught a lesson on real power.
               You...will be witnesses.  If our
               demands are not met, however --
                    (sad smile)
               -- You may become participants
               instead.
                    (beat, checking notes)
               Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is
               the man who...
                    (slight smile)
               ...used to be in charge here?

     Takagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed.

     Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand.

                           HANS (CONT'D)
                    (quite civil)
               Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My name
               is Hans Gruber.

     Takagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the
     direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the
     executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.

     INT. STAIRWELL - 33RD FLOOR - SAME

     McClane pauses outside the stairwell door to the 33rd floor,
     he presses the handle and cracks the door open TO REVEAL a
     computer floor.  The computer machinery drones on under the
     lights behind plate glass windows.  McClane quietly closes
     the door and moves to another floor.

     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Hans, Takagi, Karl and Tony.  Riding silently.  Hans alone
     seems relaxed.  He whistles.  We recognize it as a snatch of
     Wagner.

                           HANS
               Nice suit.  John Philips...London?

     Takagi stares at him, speechless.

                           HANS (CONT'D)
                    (smiles)
               I have two myself.
                    (beat, as he exits:)
               I'm told Arafat shops there too...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     McClane starts to open the stairwell door to the Machine
     Floor when a NOISE above him gets his attention.  He moves
     silently up one flight to the roof.  Quietly, he cracks the
     door and looks out onto a Machine Floor on the lower level
     of the roof.

     MCCLANE'S P.O.V.

     Three terrorist, JAMES, ULI and HEINRICH, are unpacking the
     wooden crates we saw in the garage from the service elevator.

     It's not clear what they're doing but it seems very military
     like and ominously defensive.  Heinrich POINTS up to the
     ceiling and says something in German.  The others nod.
     Heinrich starts to turn towards the CAMERA and:

     MCCLANE

     closes the door and slips back down the stairs.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BOARD ROOM FLOOR - NIGHT

     Hans enters, looks around.

                           HANS
               And when Alexander saw the breadth
               of his domain, he wept.  For there
               were no more worlds to conquer.
                    (to Takagi)
               The benefits of a classical education.

     Hans admired a scale model of a bridge.  Behind him are
     photographs of the gorge where the bridge will be constructed.

     Karl and Tony listen.  Takagi watches.

                           HANS (CONT'D)
               It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed
               models as a boy.  The exactness, the
               attention to every foreseeable
               detail...  perfection.

                           TAKAGI
                    (defensively)
               This is what this is about?  Out
               building project in Indonesia?
               Contrary to what you people think,
               we're going to develop that region...
               not 'exploit' it.

     Hans straightens, looks hard at Takagi.

                           HANS
               I believe you.
                    (smiling)
               I read the article in Forbes.

     Takagi looks confused.  Hans puts a friendly arm around
     Takagi's shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board
     room where Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer
     console.

                           HANS (CONT'D)
               Mr. Takagi, we could discuss
               industrialization or men's fashions
               all day, but I'm afraid my associate,
               Mr. Theo, has some questions for
               you.  Sort of fill-in-the blanks
               questions actually...

                                                        JUMP CUT:

     A COMPUTER SCREEN SPITS OUT:

     NAKATOMI CORPORATION.

     BOARD WORKSTATION.

     ENTER CENTRAL COMPUTER CODE KEY

     THEO

     sits fingers poised over the keyboard.  Hans sits opposite.

     Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has
     just read the screen, blurts:

                           TAKAGI
               I don't have that code...!
                    (beat; to Hans)
               You broke in here to access out
               computer?!?  Any information you
               could get -- they wake up in Tokyo
               in the morning, they'll change it!
               You won't be able to blackmail our
               executives or threaten --

     HANS BARKS HIM TO SILENCE:

                           HANS
               SIT DOWN!

     Takagi complies.  Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet.

                           HANS (CONT'D)
               Mr. Takagi...I'm not interested in
               your computer.
                    (beat)
               I'm interested in the 640 million
               dollars in negotiable bearer bonds
               you have in your vault.

     ON Takagi's reaction.

                           HANS (CONT'D)
               Yes...I know about them.  The code
               key is a necessary step in accessing
               the vault.

                           TAKAGI
               You want...money?  What kind of
               terrorists are you?

                           HANS

               Who said we were terrorists?

     MCCLANE - ENTERING THIS FLOOR

     He tiptoes along, gun held ready.  He can HEAR the MUMBLE of
     voices from the conference room, moves slowly towards it.

     CONFERENCE ROOM - RESUME

     Hans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer.  He feels
     his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips
     it back into his coat pocket.

                           HANS
                    (weighing the gun)
               The code key, please...?

                           TAKAGI
               It's useless to you!  There's seven
               safeguards on our vault, and the
               code key is only one of them!  You'll
               never get it open!

     Hans lifts the gun.

               Then there's no reason not to tell

               It's not over...

     Hans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster,
     turns back to Takagi.

                           HANS
               This is too nice a suit to ruin, Mr.
               Takagi.  I'm going to count to three.
               There will not be a four.  Give me
               the code.

     HE COCKS THE GUN:

               I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn
               jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman!
               I'm telling you!  You're just going

     reacts as if shot.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The glass doors to the boardroom are splattered red and
     dripping...

     INSIDE

     Takagi is still seated, but the chair is flat on its back,
     blood flowing out into the carpet.

     HANS SPRINGS TO HIS FEET:

     Karl, in the midst of handing Theo a fifty dollar bill, nods.

     OUTSIDE - MCCLANE

     stunned, sees Hans move and tries to retreat.  But his gun
     bumps the underside of the table:

     INSIDE - HANS

     hears it.  Karl is the first to move:

     KARL

     springs through the door, finds nothing.  He checks two
     adjoining rooms, the first is deserted.  The second...is
     locked.

     KARL

     returns to Hans.

                           KARL
               Nothing...

     SETTLES ON the door that Karl found locked.

     MACHINE LEVEL - TIGHT ON CEILING

     Heinrich PRESSES something into a niche here, scrambles like

     JUMPS down, moves to another area, climbs up again, removing
     something from his shoulder bag.

     VAULT ROOM - 31ST FLOOR

     Hans and Theo enter the safe room.  The huge corporate safe
     looms in front of them.  Theo places three kit bags onto a
     table and rolls up his sleeves.  He swivels a computer console
     into handy reach, sits down.

     32ND FLOOR

     McClane moves out onto the 31st floor, angry at himself.

                           MCCLANE
               Why the fuck didn't you stop him?
                    (beat)
               Because, you ignorant sonofabitch,
               you'd be dead, too.  Think...think,
               Goddamnit!

     Suddenly he looks up at the ceiling and sees a sprinkler
     head.

     His look drops to the wall and focuses on a small red fire
     alarm switch by the door.

     INT. MAIN FLOOR - L.A. FIRE STATION - NIGHT

     An ALARM sounds.  Quickly firemen move to their machines as
     a voice of a 911 DISPATCHER drones.

                           911 DISPATCHER
               Main Wilshire units.  Two alarm fire
               at Nakatomi Plaza --

     The voice continues as the station doors open and we:

     INT. NAKATOMI - GROUND FLOOR OPERATIONS ROOM - SAME

     A fire alarm indicator light showing which floor has sounded
     the fire alarm -- suddenly begins flashing, emitting short,
     loud beeps.  Eddie, the terrorist in the guard's uniform and
     manning the station, immediately picks up his CB.

     32ND FLOOR - SAME

     McClane stands at windows looking Northward for fire trucks.

     Suddenly we SEE the flashing red lights of FOUR ENGINES in
     traffic two miles away.

                           MCCLANE
               C'mon, baby...come to Papa.  I'm

                    presses talk button
                    again)
               Eddie?  What floor did the alarm go
               off?

     MACHINE FLOOR

     They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and Uli
     HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work.

     UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME

     McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the
     distance he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica
     onto Avenue of the Stars.

     Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on
     the second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow
     and turn down separate side streets, heading for home.

                           MCCLANE
                    (realizing)
               Son of a bitch...

     Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR
     DOORS OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his
     machine gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area
     until he reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating
     the entire floor.  McClane is gone.

     ON MCCLANE

     under a desk.  He takes in his options.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane
     Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a
     series of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a
     clear path if he can make it past Tony.

     TONY

     He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.

                           TONY
               The fire has been called off, my
               friend.  No one is coming to help
               you.  You might as well come out and
               join the others.
                    (fingers the trigger
                    of his machine gun)
               I promise not to hurt you.

     Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then
     around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.
     As the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears
     another SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the
     room near the cubicles.

     Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past
     each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches
     the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the
     partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.

     TONY'S P.O.V.

     A radial arm saw spins noisily.

     TONY

     grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not
     realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,
     steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel
     against Tony's temple.

                           MCCLANE
               Freeze, Police...don't move or name
               your beneficiary.

     Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him
     calmly.

                           TONY
               You won't hurt me.

                           MCCLANE
               Yeah?  Why not?

                           TONY
                    (smug)
               Because you are a policeman.  There
               are rules for policemen.

                           MCCLANE
               Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling me
               the same thing.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony
     REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               Let's go.

     Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the
     big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and
     sends his pistol into the hall.

     Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the
     desk.

     He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that
     sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they
     slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen
     across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and
     crash

     INTO:

     STAIRWELL LANDING

     then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing
     below.

     For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding
     onto Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops
     sickeningly to the side.

     For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then,
     slowly, methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all
     his pockets inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares
     long and very hard at a California driver's license with
     Tony's picture on it.  He expertly examines the machine gun
     when a HISSING SOUND coming from somewhere attracts his
     attention.

     He rises, moves cautiously to the source.

     NEW ANGLE

     It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist
     during the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a
     plan.

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT

     PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on
     the floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead
     terrorist's boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace
     and tries to take a couple of steps.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking
     the boots off.

                           MCCLANE
               A million terrorists in the world
               and I kill the one with feet smaller
               than my sister.

     He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.
     Then he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's
     chair.

     He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves
     to:

     A DESK

     Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.

     Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles
     to himself.

     IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR

     TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel
     chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)

     CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th
     and 30th floors.

     We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a
     wooden desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.

     The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After
     it's dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors
     open with his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.

     Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens
     the outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers
     and pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto
     the roof of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches
     over the edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors
     and setting the car in motion again.

     HOSTAGE FLOOR

     The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the
     center of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators
     are barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where
     Ginny and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on
     the floor.

     Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern
     camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.

                           HANS
               I wanted this to be professional,
               efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not
               a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi
               did not see it that way...
                    (harder)
               So he won't be joining us for the
               rest of his life.
                    (as that sinks in)
               We are prepared to go any way you
               make us.  When we have achieved our
               aims you can walk out of here...  or
               be carried out.  Decide now, each of
               you.  But remember that we have
               planned everything to the last detail.
               We are completely in change.

     A "DING" attracts his attention.  He turns.

     NEW ANGLE

     The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area.  WHIRLS,
     gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:

     TONY'S BODY - HIS P.O.V.

     Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat
     gaily placed on his head.

     HANS

     REACTS.

                           HANS (CONT'D)
                    (indicating the
                    hostages)
               Get them over there.  Schnell!

     The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses
     to the elevator, but not before.

     HOLLY

     Sees the body...and REACTS.  She knows her husband's
     abilities...  not to mention his twisted sense of humor.

     NEAR THE ELEVATOR

     As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator
     with Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has
     been snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's
     collar, takes it out.

     INSERT - THE NOTE

     It reads, "Now I have a machine gun.  HO-HO-HO."

     BACK TO SCENE

                           FRITZ
               Perhaps a security guard we
               overlooked...?

     Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.

                           HANS
                    (thoughtfully)
               Security guard?  They're usually
               tired and burned out old policemen
               growing fat on a pension...This is...
               something else.

     ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME

     McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below
     him.

     CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and Franco
     just below.

     McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.
     The first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30-odd.
     Then it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds
     "3? 1 in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on roof
     (3)."

                           FRITZ'S VOICE
                    (slightly spooked)
               We have to do something, Hans.

                           HANS' VOICE
                    (not pleased)
               Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother
               is dead.  Tell him to come down.

     Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"

     As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.

                           HANS
               Franco, you and Fritz take the body
               upstairs and out of sight.  I don't
               want the hostages to think too much.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME

     On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.
     Franco and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the
     elevator close.

     The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,
     grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes
     are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from
     the dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing
     the car bringing Karl down to the hostage floor --and stops
     at the machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them
     roll the chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.

     MCCLANE'S P.O.V.

     A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.

     MCCLANE

     pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk
     looking for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door,
     2'x3'.  McClane pushes it open and looks in.

     MCCLANE'S P.O.V.

     Total darkness.

     MCCLANE

     takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.

     Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we
     HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't
     have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.

                           MCCLANE
               Jesus...

     He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder
     leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door
     McClane enters a darkened:

     PUMP ROOM

     damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks
     the door and looks out.

     MCCLANE'S P.O.V.

     The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a
     heliport above him is higher.

     30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME

     WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers
     SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's
     barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a
     hole into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays
     controlling hands on the man's shoulder.

                           HANS
               I know what you are feeling.  But
               this is not productive --

                           KARL
                    (pushing him away)
               He was my only brother...my only
               family!
                    (a flat statement)
               I want blood for my blood.  We
               search...now.

     He starts to move.  Hans stops him.

                           HANS
                    (firmly)
               No.  Heinrich's team must finish
               planting the detonators...and Theo
               needs time on the vault.  After the
               police come they'll waste hours trying
               to negotiate...that's when we search*
               for this man.  Until then...we do
               not alter the plan.

                           KARL
                    (quietly)
               And if he alters it...?

     For once Hans doesn't have an answer.

     HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER

     They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation
     among their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly.

                           ELLIS

               John?  Christ, he could fuck this

               he's doing?

                           HOLLY
               How about his job?

                           ELLIS
               His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without
               him, they might let us go...at least
               we have a chance...

                           HOLLY

               Tell that to Mr. Takagi.

               Mayday, Mayday!  Anyone!  Terrorists
               have seized and Nakatomi building
               and are holding 30 or more hostages!
               I say again --

     INT. HANS' OFFICE - SAME

     Hans, Karl, Fritz and Franco hear the clear signal over Hans'
     CB.

               -- unknown number of terrorists, six
               or more, armed with automatic weapons
               at Nakatomi, Century City...  Somebody
               answer me, Goddamnit!

     Karl looks almost...satisfied.

                    (frowning)
               -- the false alarm?  I'll handle it.

     She plugs in her headset.  (Her condescending, arrogant tone
     is like the one in the famous tape where the dispatch lady
     spends so much time on red tape that the patient dies.)

                           SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)

     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON KARL - SAME

     with Franco and Fritz.

                           KARL
               No one kills him but me.

     It's an order and the look he gives the other two backs it
     up.

     Karl checks his magazine, SLAPS it into his rifle as the
     elevator opens to the roof.

     EXT. UPPER ROOF

     McClane moves around the roof, circling the helipad, making
     sure he has a good enough view to avoid being ambushed.  He
     can't see in all directions at once but he's doing the best
     he can.

                           MCCLANE
               They've already killed one hostage,
               and they're fortifying their positions
               while we're bullshitting!  Now, send
               police backup ASAP!

     Suddenly machine gun shells rip into the concrete wall in
     front of him.  The noise is deadening as we:

     INT. DISPATCHER OFFICE - SAME

     Both Supervisor and Dispatcher reach for their headsets in
     pain from the INTENSE SOUND and:

     Running.  Tracer bullets rip into the wall behind him.  He
     reaches the corner and sees the other two terrorists moving
     toward him.  Before they see him, he leaps down to the next
     level out of range of Karl.

     INT. EMERGENCY DISPATCH - SAME

     The Dispatcher looks critically at the Supervisor in the
     sudden silence.

                           SUPERVISOR

     INT. 7-11 - AT THE COUNTER - NIGHT

     TIGHT as one after another after another HOSTESS TWINKIE is
     stacked up on the counter.  CAMERA WIDENS and we SEE the
     young male CLERK, who stifles a smile.  Another teenage
     employee behind the counter also smothers a laugh.

     The customer is POWELL, young for a police veteran, old for
     the rest of the world.

                           CLERK
               Thought you guys just ate donuts.

                           POWELL
               They're for my wife.  She's pregnant.
               If I knew she was gonna eat a dozen
               at a shot, I woulda bought stock in
               the company.

     The Clerk nods and puts them in a bag.  As Powell pays,
     suddenly his BELT RADIO crackles to life.

                           DISPATCHER'S VOICE/RADIO
               Dispatch to One Adam Ten, over.

     Powell grabs the radio, speaks into it.

                           POWELL
               One Adam Ten, go ahead.

                    (thinking)
               Nakatomi Plaza?

     He moves to the door, steps outside.

     EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE                                107-A

     Powell looks towards the horizon and up.

     There it is, Nakatomi, in all its gleaming glory.

                           DISPATCH VOICE
               One Adam Ten, do you copy?

     Powell is already moving to the car.  He tosses in the
     twinkies, hops behind the wheel.

                           POWELL
                    (into police radio)
               Roger, dispatch.  I'm on the way.

     And he BURNS RUBBER leaving the store:

     running for his life, from Fritz and Franco, doesn't realize
     he is being herded around the building toward Karl.  Suddenly
     McClane turns a corner and sees Karl.  The big man fires a
     burst and McClane ducks back stopping at the exterior door
     to the pump room he used before.  It is locked from the
     inside.

     He BLOWS the lock off with a burst from his machine gun and
     slips into the darkness of the:

     ELEVATOR SHAFT NEAR PUMP ROOM

     Coming quickly out of the pump room, McClane picks his way
     over the same ground as a few minutes before and opens the
     door to the elevator shaft.  The dimly lit shaft yawns before
     him.

     He starts down the ladder back to the catwalk, moves along
     it -- STOPS.

     The catwalk ends, and the elevator is gone.

     INT. PUMP ROOM - OTHER END

     Karl crosses, starts to open the door to the elevator shaft

     When suddenly their radio crackles with --

                           HANS' VOICE
               Karl?  Franco?  Did you catch him?

                           FRANCO
               No, but he's in the elevator shaft.

                           HANS' VOICE
               Prefect.  The elevators are locked
               off.  He can't escape.  Just shut
               him in and return to base.

                           KARL
               Hans, he killed my brother --

                           HANS
                    (more firmly)
               Karl, I know you want him, but the
               police are probably on their way.
               Maybe we can convince them it was
               all a mistake, but not if they hear
               gunshots!  If you lock him in he'll
               be neutralized-- now do it!  Karl?
               Karl!

     Karl turns off his radio.  In the light of their flashlights,
     the two other terrorists look at Karl in stunned disbelief.

     He opens the door to the elevator shaft.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ON MCCLANE

     He's OVERHEARD enough of this to realize he's in deep shit.

     He backtracks to the air shaft door, strikes a cigarette
     lighter.

     ELEVATOR SHAFT (OPPOSITE SIDE)

     Karl steps off the ladder to the catwalk, his own gun held
     ready.

     HEARING Karl's approach, McClane thinks fast, looks down at
     his narrow confines, and then at:

     HIS WEAPON

     and its canvas gunsling and metal strap slides.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Quickly, McClane lets out all the slack in the sling.  Then,
     he BRACES the weapon across the outside opening of the air
     shaft door and lowers himself into the:

     AIR SHAFT

     meanwhile holding onto the canvas sling with his elbows bent
     over it like a kid doing a half-assed skin-the-cat on a swing
     set.

     His feet slowly move down the smooth aluminum walls until
     they reach the top of the air duct, then DANGLE in the open
     space.

     He straightens his arms to give him length enough to touch
     the bottom edge of the duct.

     Suddenly he FEELS something GIVE above him and looks up.

     CLOSE ON THE SLING

     It was designed to carry a gun on a man, not vice versa.
     The few inches of extra canvas are sliding through the clips.

     When they're gone...he will be too.

     KARL

     He moves silently toward the corner.

     CLOSE - MCCLANE'S TOES

     now only inches from the bottom edge.  McClane's arms are
     fully extended now.  He hears Karl on the metal catwalk.
     His muscles strain and quiver.

     THE SLING

     One of the canvas end slips through the clip.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     ON MCCLANE

     FALLING.  He grabs the ledge of the air duct as he falls and
     his body slams into the aluminum wall with an echoing BOOM.

     Above him on the catwalk the rifle rattles on the metal
     outside the door.

     ON KARL

     Around the corner Karl FREEZES, unsure of the sound:

     ON MCCLANE

     holding onto the ledge by his hands.  With every ounce of
     strength he tries to pull himself up into the horizontal
     duct, clawing for a hold.

     ON KARL

     He rounds the corner and sees McClane's rifle lying beneath
     the doorway.  He moves to the small door, shines his light
     and aims his rifle down into the air shaft ready to fire.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The shaft is deserted.  Moving his light around he sees the
     air duct.  Without hesitation he turns and backtracks to the
     pump room door.

     INT. AIR CONDITIONING DUCT - ON MCCLANE - SAME

     He lies exhausted and motionless in the narrow crawl space.
     He awkwardly fishes out the lighter from his shirt pocket
     and thumbs it ON.

     The flickering GLOW shows him this ain't no place for
     claustrophobics -- it's a long, long long dark and narrow
     corridor full of weird shadows.  The far end (if there even
     if one?) is BLACK.

                           MCCLANE
               Whew...for a moment there I was
               worried.

     He turns out his lighter, and starts crawling.

     INT. MACHINE FLOOR

     The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit,
     Karl leading the way through the door.  Karl points quickly
     to the left and right where there are a series of rooms.
     The others checks these while Karl approaches the CAMERA,
     trigger finger ITCHING.

     Almost immediately, the others return.

                           FRANCO
                    (a whisper)
               Nothing.

     Karl looks puzzled.  Then he thinks, mentally retracing
     McClane's few options.  Karl's eyes scan the architecture
     here, and then suddenly he looks UP.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The ceiling is criss-crossed with air ducts.  He fires a*
     burst into the ducts.

     INT. AIR DUCT - SAME

     McClane remains motionless in the air duct.  Three quarter-
     size holes inches from his face show how close Karl came to
     nailing him.  Sweat covers his face, drips silently onto the
     aluminum.

     MACHINE ROOM

     Karl listens patiently for sound.  Just then the two other
     terrorists return.

                           FRANCO
               Nothing.

     Karl hesitates a moment, fighting his instincts before finally
     turning to go.  Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS
     slightly under his weight.  Karl stops and looks up at the
     matrix of aluminum duct work, trying to single out the source
     of the sound.  He steps back into the room and raises his
     rifle.

     Holding it upright he presses the barrel up into the belly
     of McClane's air duct, feeling for weight -- the weight of a
     body.

     INSIDE THE AIR DUCT

     McClane sees the indention of the barrel pressing into the
     aluminum fifteen feet away.  There is a pause and another
     three feet closer.  He can hear Karl's footsteps on the
     concrete -- moving slowly below the duct.

     ON KARL

     His eyes are fixed above him on the air duct.  He presses
     the barrel up again.  Still nothing.

     ON MCCLANE

     Silently he moves his hand, slowly draws his Beretta.  The
     next indention presses up six feet away.  McClane points his
     gun downward and waits.

     KARL

     stops directly below him.  The barrel starts up and just
     touches the duct under McClane when Franco returns to the
     door and calls:

                           FRANCO
               Karl!  Police!  Come on.

     Karl hesitates then lowers his gun and leaves.

     CLOSE - MCCLANE

     He hears the door close and lowers his head.

     INT. 33RD FLOOR - SAFE ROOM

     The large LED WINDOW in the front of the safe BEEPS and
     letters creep by:  ACCESS CODE ACCEPTED.  We HEAR a CLUNK.

     CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Theo, who grins.  Now his computer
     screen reads, LOCK #1 DISABLED.  DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED?

     Theo puts goggles on his eyes, holds out his hands towards
     Kristoff like a doctor requesting a scalpel.  Kristoff gives
     him a GIANT DRILL.

                           THEO
               You bet your ass I'm gonna proceed.

     HE TURNS ON THE DRILL:

     EXT. CENTURY CITY - AVENUE OF THE STARS - NIGHT

     The street is empty, quiet.  A lone police black-and-white
     pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow
     cruise toward the Nakatomi building.

     ON POWELL

     Driving, alone.  He starts up at the tower.  It seems calm,
     its glowing lights matching the warmth of the holiday
     decorations on the streets.  Powell slows to a stop and scans
     the premises.  In the lobby we SEE Eddie, sitting behind the
     desk.  Powell reports to his radio.

               Guard inside.  No signs of disturbance
               ...I'm going up for a closer look.

     He pulls in and parks in the front.

     INT. MACHINE ROOM - SAME

     McClane punches out a ceiling vent and drops down into the
     machine room.  For a moment he stands, listening for sounds
     of movement.  The floor is quiet.  He goes to the stairwell.

     EXT. ROOF - SAME

     The edge of the roof.  Suddenly a tall terrorist, James,
     moves along the wall and looks over at Powell's car.

     INT. 3RD FLOOR - SAME

     The elevator doors open on Karl, Franco and Fritz.  They
     step out onto the darkened floor.  We SEE large number "3"
     painted on the doors of this floor.

     They move quickly toward the windows on the Avenue of the
     Stars side where a terrorist, ALEXANDER, with a BAR rifle
     has set up a machine gun nest under a half-opened window.
     Directly below him we SEE Powell's car.

     Alexander PANS the police car with his weapon, finger on the
     trigger.  This is clearly a man hungry for action.

     ALEXANDER

     also hears this, and his eager expression fades.  But orders
     are orders.

     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF NAKATOMI - SAME

     Powell tries the front doors.  Locked.  Eddie comes hustling
     across and unlocks the door with the magnetic card.

                           EDDIE
               Evening, officer.  What's up?

     Powell steps in and looks around.  Bland HOLIDAY MUZAK filters
     from Speakers here.   (LET IT SNOW)

                           POWELL
               We got an emergency call that there
               was a problem here.

     INT. 34TH FLOOR - BOARD ROOM - SAME

     McClane makes his way to the Avenue of the Stars side of the

     HIS P.O.V.

     Powell's car.

                           MCCLANE
               All right!

     McClane waits, expectant.  Five seconds.  Ten seconds.  But
     no commotion, no shouting.  He frowns.

     Powell walks casually across the slick floor, eyes panning
     the area.  Eddie sits casually watching a game on one of his
     monitor screens.

                           EDDIE

               ask me, the Goddamn computers sent

     Powell's face shows us he's starting to think he's wasting
     his time.

     WITH MCCLANE

     The silent tension is driving him crazy.

                           MCCLANE
               Come on, come on...who's in that
               car, Stevie Wonder?

     He makes up his mind.  He lifts one of the big chairs and
     swings it at the window.  The tempered glass whitens on the
     first blow.

     EXT. ROOF                                            153-B

     INT. MACHINE FLOOR                                   153-C

     Heinrich hears the radio and shouts to Marco who grabs his

     INT. LOBBY

     Eddie watches confidently as Powell moves through the lobby
     looking for signs of trouble.

     AROUND THE CORNER FROM POWELL

     Uli is there, gun held ready.

     BOARD ROOM - 34TH FLOOR

     McClane draws the chair back for the final hit when a
     terrorist (MARCO) appears at the door.  Both men react, but
     Marco already has his gun up.  He FIRES a round at McClane.
     The bullets rip into the table top and the chair, and McClane
     goes down behind the table.

     INT. 34TH FLOOR - BOARD ROOM

     Marco smiles and moves around to the other side of the table,
     but finds no one.  He looks around frantically than squats
     beneath the table and sees:

     lying prone, his pistol trained on him.

                           MCCLANE
               Drop it or you're a rugstain.

     BOARD ROOM DOORWAY

     Just then Heinrich, the terrorist steps into the doorway,
     sees the situation.

                           HEINRICH
               Marco, duck!

     Marco dives sideways, but Heinrich still isn't quick enough.

     McClane FIRES TWICE and Heinrich DROPS sprawling in the
     hallway, machine gun FIRING BLINDLY until he hits the floor.

     HOSTAGE FLOOR

     They can FAINTLY HEAR the gunshots.  Holly pales:

     THE LOBBY

     All Powell can hear here is "LET IT SNOW, LET IT SNOW."  He
     STOPS just a yard from seeing the armed terrorist, turns
     back.

                           POWELL
               Screw this.

     He turns back.

     THE BOARD ROOM

     Marco springs on top of the huge table.  McClane rolls on
     his back so he can cover either angle but it is clear that
     Marco is in the more enviable position.

     ON MARCO

     On the table top-- slams in a fresh magazine and smiles.

                           MARCO
               Next time -- don't hesitate.

     He leans his machine gun over the edge.

     MCCLANE

     aims directly above him and fires twice into the underside
     of the table.

     The bullets rip through the table and Marco, who DROPS beside
     McClane.

                           MCCLANE
               Thanks for the advice.

     INT. LOBBY - SAME

     Powell heads for the door.  Eddie moves to lock up after
     him.

                           POWELL
               Sorry to waste your time.  Merry
               Christmas.

     Powell goes out.

     INT. 34TH FLOOR BOARD ROOM - SAME

     McClane rolls out from under the table, goes to the windows,
     and looks down in time to see Powell heading for the car.

                           MCCLANE
               Oh, man, please, no --

     Desperate, he leans on the glass...which CRACKS again, on
     the verge of going.  McClane thinks...looks over his shoulder
     at the body of Marco.

     INT. POWELL'S POLICE CAR - SAME

     Powell check in on his radio.  Unconsciously he begins to
     HUM the Muzak he overheard in the lobby.

                           POWELL
               One Adam Ten to 6421.  We had a wild
               goose chase on that 436.  Everything's
               okay here.  Over.

                    his tie, he murmurs)

               Roger, One Adam Ten.  We thought it

               '...let is snow, let it snow, let it
               snow -- '

     Suddenly Marco's body CRASHES onto the hood of his car.

                           POWELL (CONT'D)
                    (terrified)

                    radio)
               6421, this is One Adam Ten --

     Suddenly a barrage of MACHINE GUN FIRE from Alexander on the
     third floor drowns out his call!  Powell ducks and flattens
     against the seat as bullets blow out the front window,
     covering him in glass.

                           DISPATCHER'S VOICE
               Roger, One Adam Ten, please repeat.

     But Powell accelerates in reverse away from the building,
     keeping his head low and praying he doesn't hit anything as
     the bullets follow him, digging into asphalt.  A half block
     away his car runs off the pavement and down a SLOPE, finally
     BOUNCING to a jarring HALT in a parking lot which is destined
     to become police H.Q. a few pages from now.  Powell sits up
     and clutches the mike.

                           POWELL
               One Adam Ten, under automatic rifle

     He's got a CB on the table and ON, and his cop's notebook is
     out again.  He's already upgraded the NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?
     to "12 (?) minus 3 = 9" and added other information.  As he
     speaks he takes ammo clips the dead men dropped, their
     sidearms, etc.

                           MCCLANE
               Gee, I'm sorry, Hans, nobody gave me
               the message.  You shoulda put it on
               the bulletin board.  Anyway, I thought
               you and Franco and Karl and the other
               boys might be lonely, now that I
               waxed Tony and Marco and their buddy.
               So I invited some of the guys from

     In the office, the terrorists REACT, startled, as McClane
     name-drops.

     Moving down the corridor.  Now armed with Marco's machine
     gun and carrying Heinrich's kit bag, he seems more lethal.

                           MCCLANE
                    (into CB)
               BZZZ!  Sorry, Hans, wrong guess.
               Would you like to go for Double
               Jeopardy, where the stakes are double
               and the scores really change?

     He rolls Heinrich over and is delighted to find a pack of
     Gauloise's in the man's pocket.  He takes them, pats the
     dead man's face.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
                    (sotto, to the body)
               Bad for your health anyway.

               The monkey in the wrench, the pain
               in the ass -

     McClane STOPS in mid-speech.  He's just opened the kit bag
     Heinrich had over his shoulder when he died.  Now McClane
     takes out the contents...dozens and dozens of EXPLOSIVE
     DETONATORS marked "DANGER" and a CHUNK of cello-wrapped
     PLASTIQUE the size of an electric razor.  He WHISTLES in
     surprise to himself.

     In the office, Hans turns off his mike for a moment, turns
     to Karl.

                           HANS
               Check on all the others...don't use
               the radio.  See if he's lying about
               Marco  and find out if anyone else
               is missing.

     He moves.   Hans goes back onto the CB.  Meanwhile, McClane
     SMILES at the tell-tale STATIC as Hans goes off and on.  He
     knows what's happening.

     Powell stands in front of his destroyed cruiser and looks up
     at the building.  Behind him technicians, City Power and
     Light personnel, SWAT officers in protective gear, etc.,
     arrive from all directions.  A trailer is being backed into
     a parking lot, which will become the police center of
     operations.  It is like watching a small town being
     constructed right before your eyes.

                           POWELL
                    (to CB)
               What's left of him.  Can you identify
               yourself?

     INTERCUT:

     HANS AND KARL

     Listening intently.

                           MCCLANE
               Maybe later.  Just listen fast because
               this is a party line and the neighbors
               are trigger happy.  Now here's the
               skinny:  There's thirty or so hostages
               on the 30th floor, with probably 2
               or 3 guards to cover a group that
               size.  The leader here is named Hans,
               and besides the pea shooter he
               ventilated your car with, they got
               machine guns and sidearms up the yin
               yang.  On top of that one of 'em had
               a big enough chunk of plastic
               explosive to orbit Kate Smith.

     NOTE:  The following dialogue is said OVER McClane's.

                           FRANCO
               We have to find him and shut him up!
               He's telling them everything --

                           HANS
                    (shaking his head,
                    calming)
               The police are irrelevant.  We're
               waiting for the FBI.  Until they
               arrive, we can't finish out work.

     Meanwhile, let this fool waste time for the police.  Fritz,
     go help Uli find the bag.

     THE CAMERA TIGHTENS ON HIM

                           HANS (CONT'D)
               We must find those detonators.

     They leave.

     WITH MCCLANE

                           POWELL'S VOICE
               How many are there?

                           MCCLANE
                    (thinking about it)
               Figuring there's at least one to
               cover the lobby, a couple with the
               hostages...I'd say they came in with
               about a dozen...but they're down to
               nine now, including the skydiver you
               already met.  These guys are mostly
               Europeans, judging by their clothing
               labels, and they're well financed
               and very slick.

                           POWELL
               How do you know?

                           MCCLANE
               I've seen enough phoney ID's in my
               time to recognize that the ones
               they've got cost a fortune.  Add all
               that up and I don't know what the
               fuck it means, but these are bad ass -
               perps and they're here to stay.

     We notice that everything McClane has said about "clothing"
     and ID's and police jargon, etc., has set off a little buzzer
     in Powell's brain.

                           POWELL
               I hear you...
                    (on a hunch)
               Partner.  And LA's finest are on it,
               so light 'em if you got 'em.

                           MCCLANE
               I'm ahead of you...partner.

                           POWELL
               Uh, what do I call you?
                    (A moment.  McClane
                    smiles.)
               What the hell?

                           MCCLANE
               'Roy'.

                           POWELL
               Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you
               think of anything else you think we
               need to know, don't be shy, okay?
               In the meantime I want you to find a
               safe place and hole-up and let us do
               our job.  Understand?

                           MCCLANE
                    (to CB)
               They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.

     McClane turns off his CB and sits against the wall.

     EXT. POLICE OPERATIONS - NIGHT

     An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from
     Nakatomi building and a MAN in a sportcoat climbs out.

     Stocky, his hair a little too perfect, the very fact that he
     is the Deputy Chief of Police Operations on a Christmas Eve
     gives some evidence to his position in the pecking order.
     His name is DWAYNE T. ROBINSON and he moves brusquely past
     police technicians and goes to the forward group of officers.

                           ROBINSON
               Who's talking to them?

     POWELL TURNS AROUND

                           POWELL
               I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.

                           ROBINSON
               Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have
               you learned?  What do they want?

                           POWELL
               The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir.
               We haven't heard a peep from them.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           ROBINSON
                    (puzzled)
               Then who the hell have you been
               talking too?

                           POWELL
               We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't
               give us him name.  He appears to be
               the man who called in the report...
               he's killed one of the terrorists
               for sure and claims he capped two
               others.

                           ROBINSON
                    (exasperated)
               He claims?  Powell, has it occurred
               to you he could be one of the
               terrorists, pulling your chain?  Or
               some kind of nut case who --

                           POWELL
               I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I
               think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD,
               but definitely a badge.

                           ROBINSON
               How do you know?

                           POWELL
               A hunch.  Things he said.  Like,
               knowing how to recognize a phony ID --

                           ROBINSON
                    (exasperated)
               -- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ,
               Powell, he could be a fucking
               bartender for all we know!

     Something draws Robinson's attention.  He looks at:

     HIS P.O.V. - REMOTE NEWS TRUCK

     Pulling up and parking just beyond the barricades.  Richard
     Thornburg gets out, starts supervising the* positioning of
     cameras.

     BACK TO SCENE

                           ROBINSON
               Oh shit...

     HOSTAGE FLOOR

     Hans examines building plans at Holly's desk.  Behind him
     the TV is ON, the sound muted.  TV cops triumph over oafish
     bad guys.

     Hans looks up as Fritz brings in Holly.

                           HOLLY
               I...have a request.

                           HANS
               Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?

                           HOLLY
                    (evenly)
               You did.
                    (on his look)
               You murdered my Boss.  Now...
                    (waving towards the
                    hostages)
               They're looking to me.  Personally
               I'd pass on the job.  I don't enjoy
               being this close to you.

     Hans is impressed by her candor.  And she's easy enough on
     the eyes.

                           HANS
               Go on.

                           HOLLY
               We have a pregnant woman out there --
                    (on his look)
               -- relax, she's not due for two
               weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing
               her back any good.  I'd like
               permission for her to more to one of
               the offices where there's a sofa.

                           HANS
               No.  But I'll have a sofa brought
               out to you.  Good enough?

                           HOLLY
               Good enough.  And unless you like it
               messy, you'd better start taking us
               in groups to the bathroom.

                           HANS
                    (nods)
               Yes, you're right.  It will be done.

     He nods to one of his men, and she is waved to the door: AS
     SHE GOES:

                           HANS (CONT'D)
               Mr. Takagi chose his people well,
               Mrs...?

                           HOLLY
               Gennero.  Miss Gennero.

     He nods, thoughtful.  She goes out.  Hans suddenly notices:

     CLOSER - TV

     A slide "SPECIAL BULLETIN" has appeared.  This changes to a
     SHOT of the Nakatomi building with "LIVE" supered over it.
     Richard Thornburg is in front. The CAMERA TIGHTENS ON him.

                           THORNBURG
               This is Richard Thornburg, speaking
               to you live from Century City...
               where Los Angeles has joined the sad
               but world wide fraternity whose only
               membership requirement is the awesome
               spectre of International Terrorism...

     ANOTHER TV SCREEN - NIGHT

     As Thornburg Continues, we PULL BACK.  We're WITH Argyle in
     the back seat of the limo.

                           ARGYLE
                    (reaching for the
                    remote)
               What else is new...?

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the Nakatomi Building rise
     up in the b.g. behind Thornburg.

                           ARGYLE (CONT'D)
                    (stunned)
               Holy shit...

                           THORNBURG
               We're told that the situation began
               some two hours ago when an
               unidentified party of men took over
               the building and sealed off all of
               its entrances and exits...

     Argyle is already bailing out of the car.

     EXT. LIMO - IN THE GARAGE

     Argyle looks at the metal gates, swallows.  He JUMPS back in
     the car.

     BACK INSIDE

     Argyle pours himself a stiff drink.

                           THORNBURG
                    (on TV)
               Since all the telephone lines have
               been cut, the only contact with the
               building had been through the use of
               CB communicators which the terrorists
               brought with them.  Strangely enough,
               so far the terrorists have not
               communicated directly with the
               police... but an unidentified man
               has had several conversations which
               seem to indicate...

     Argyle nearly spills his drink as he leans over the front
     seat and turns on the CB.

                                                          CUT TO:

     OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - SAME TIME

     Signs of activity along the edges and shadows of the area.

     Men and vehicles.  The SNAP of weapons and breeches.

     Footsteps running in unison.  Powell picks up on this, turns
     to Robinson, who is standing with the SWAT Captain, MITCHELL.

                           POWELL
               What's going on?

                           ROBINSON
               What's it look like?  We're going
               in.

                           POWELL
                    (flabbergasted)
               Going in...are you out of your mind?
               There's 30 hostages in there -- for
               all we know --

                           ROBINSON
               -- all we know?  We don't know shit,
               Powell.  If there's hostages why
               hasn't anyone asked for ransom?

                           ROBINSON (CONT'D)
               If there's terrorists, where's their
               goddamn list of demands?  All we
               know is that someone shot up your
               car, and it could be the same flake
               you've been talking to on the radio!

                           POWELL
               What about the body that fell out of
               the window -- ?

                           ROBINSON
               Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a
               stockbroker who looked at the Dow
               Jones and opted for early retirement!

                           MITCHELL
               Chief, we're ready.

                           ROBINSON
               I'm coming.

                           MITCHELL
                    (into radio)
               Rivers.

                           RIVERS
                    (over radio)
               Yo.

                           MITCHELL
               Begin your reconnoiter.

     MCCLANE

     Inside the building, sadly realizing that the Marlboro pack
     has only two more to go.  He savors the dregs of his current
     number, then suddenly becomes aware of an almost EERIE QUIET.

     He moves to the window.

     HIS P.O.V. - OUTSIDE

     Hints of activity in the darkness.  A LIGHT FLARES
     extinguished.

     Shadows move on trailer walls.

     BACK TO SCENE

                           MCCLANE
                    (spooked, into CB)
               Powell?  Al, you still with me?
               What's going on?  Al?

     INTERCUT:

     OUTSIDE

     Powell stiffens.  Robinson looks at him warningly, shakes
     his head.

                           POWELL
               I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of
               busy.  Let's talk later, okay?

                           MCCLANE
               Al, what's wrong?  Did something --
                    (realizing)
               -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's
               it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I
               told you what you're dealing with
               here --

                           POWELL
               I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If
               you're what I think you are you should
               know when to listen, when to shut
               up... and when to pray.

     Hating himself, Powell DISCONNECTS, watches LIGHTS snaps on
     in the parking lot to illuminate the area.

     Also hating himself, McClane does the same thing.  Pale, he
     moves to a window to watch what he knows is going to be
     brutal.

     IN HOLLY'S OFFICE - HANS

     He hunches over his communicator.

                           HANS
               They'll be coming.  Get ready.  Theo,
               watch the screens.  Be our eyes and
               ears.
                    (pause)
               Wait until they're close.

     EDDIE

     slips away from the desk, a computer card in his hand.  He
     meets up with another terrorist and they move behind a slit
     in the wall.  Eddie waves his card at the sensor and a METAL
     GRID crashes into place.  They hold their weapons behind it,
     ready.

     VARIOUS SHOTS - TERRORISTS - ON OTHER FLOORS

     All now with earplugs in their CB's, taking up positions:

     AT THE LOBBY DOOR

     The SWAT team leader moves in SOP style to the door, scans
     it carefully.

     EXT. CENTURY CITY - ON MITCHELL AND ROBINSON

                           POLICE BARRICADES
               Mitchell listens to CB radio.

                           RIVERS
                    (over radio)
               We're in position.

     Mitchell looks at Robinson, who is visibly tense.  Robinson
     hesitates, then gives his approval with a nod.

                           MITCHELL
                    (to CB)
               Go.

     QUICK SHOTS - INSIDE THE LOBBY

     The SECURITY CAMERAS on the walls PAN and ZOOM:

     THE VAULT DOOR

     Kristoff DRILLS AWAY, is rewarded with the message FIFTH
     LOCK DEACTIVATED.  DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE?  Nearby, Theo
     sits at a bank of monitors.  Screen after screen pinpoints
     all the police activity outside, down to the last detail.
     Theo SMILES.

     Suddenly we RECOGNIZE that tune he's been whistling.  It's
     "Singin' In The Rain."

                           THEO
                    (into a throat mike)
               It was the night before Xmas, and
               all through the house, not a creature
               was stirring, expect for the four
               assholes coming in the rear in
               standard 2 X 2 cover formation.

     INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

     Eddie and another terrorist, ULI, take up prone firing
     positions, using the gaps in the steel partition like
     gunpoints.

     ANGLE ON TWO SWAT OFFICERS

     Mitchell and Robinson watch from behind the cover of a police
     car as the SWAT officers remove a portable welding torch and
     begin cutting their way through the locks.

     INT. 33RD FLOOR - MCCLANE

     He moves painfully to the window and looks out.  He can't
     see a thing because of the lights.

                           MCCLANE
                    (to himself)
               No...

     EXT. POLICE BARRICADES - ON MITCHELL AND ROBINSON

     Suddenly rifle fire sounds from the building.

                           ROBINSON
                    (worriedly)
               They're shooting at them

                           MITCHELL
                    (calmly)
               It's panic fire...they can't see
               anything.

                           POWELL
                    (under breath)
               They're shooting at the lights.

     More shots ring out from the building going over the SWAT
     officers' heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the
     spotlights shatters behind Mitchell and Robinson's head.

     The glow fades.  A moment later the next light twenty feet
     away dies.

                           ROBINSON
               They're going after the lights!

     The two SWAT officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look
     up as their cover starts to disappear.

                           ROBINSON (CONT'D)
               Call them back.

                           MITCHELL
               No, they're almost in.

     Suddenly the third and fourth lights are shot out and the
     SWAT men become sitting ducks.

     He calmly speak into his CB.

                           HANS
               Don't get impatient.  Just wound
               them.

     INT. LOBBY

     Eddie and Uli fire.  They hit one of the officers in the
     leg, the second one in the arm.

     EXT. POLICE BARRICADES - ON MITCHELL AND ROBINSON

                           MITCHELL
                    (on radio)
               Send in the car!

     An armored car wheels toward the building and starts toward
     the wounded men.

     INT. ROOF-MACHINE ROOM/SERVICE ELEVATOR - SAME

     JAMES and Alexander quickly load two crates onto the service
     elevator and push the button for the 3rd floor.  As the car
     starts down, they remove an anti-tank gun from one of the
     crates.

     WITH THEO - WATCHING SCREENS

                           THEO
               Well, what have we here.  The
               police've got themselves an R.V.
               James, Alexander, southeast corner.

     INT. 3RD FLOOR - SAME

     The service elevator arrives on the 3rd floor and James and
     Alexander move across the room toward the windows with the
     anti-tank weapon.  At the window, they prepare the weapon
     for use.

     Outside the window the armored car has stopped in front of
     the wounded man and paramedics quickly load them in from the
     sheltered side of the vehicle.  Alexander quickly sights on
     the armored car.

                           ALEXANDER
                    (to Hans, CB)

                           HANS' VOICE
                    (o.s., over CB)
               Fire.

     EXT. THE ARMORED CAR

     A blast ROARS from the third floor window and the shell hits
     the armored car.  The car pitches forward like a beast whose
     front legs have been shot out from under it -- its front
     axle destroyed, unable to move.  Alexander looks back at
     James and grins.

     30TH FLOOR - HANS

     He watches from his window.  Coldly picks up his CB.

                           HANS
               Hit it again.

     MCCLANE

     listening.  He picks up his CB.

                           MCCLANE
               Hans, you motherfucker, you've made
               your point.  Let them pull back!

                           HANS' VOICE
               Thank you Mr. Cowboy, I'll take it
               under advisement.  His it again.

     McClane slumps to the floor below the window.  He feels
     helpless, then notices his kit bag.

     3RD FLOOR

     James runs back to the crate on the elevator.

     EXT. POLICE BARRICADE - ON ROBINSON AND MITCHELL

     They look on in horror as the armored car sits helplessly on
     fire.  On the police radio channel we HEAR the screams of
     men inside.

     James opens the box of shells and takes two and starts back
     across the room.

     INT. 33RD FLOOR - CLOSE ON A SHAPE ON PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE -
     SAME

     Like a football.  It sits on the seat of a secretary's chair
     with castors.  We PULL BACK TO SEE McClane press three
     detonators into the top, then cover the explosive with a
     typewriter, tying it securely in place with electrical cords.

     ANGLE ON SERVICE ELEVATOR - MCCLANE

     wheels the chair to the service elevator, opens the door and
     block them with a fire axe.  He looks in -- the top of the
     car can just be seen thirty-five floors below.

     INT. 3RD FLOOR

     James hands the shell to Alexander, who expertly loads it
     into the anti-tank gun.  Alexander lifts the  gun to his
     shoulder and aims.

     INT. 38TH FLOOR

     McClane push the chair into the shaft.

                           MCCLANE
               Geronimo...motherfuckers.

     For a long moment there is nothing, then:  the shaft is filled
     with light, then SOUND -- an ungodly ROAR -- and McClane is
     thrown back across the elevator corridor against the other
     back of doors by the concussion wave.

     ON THE 3RD FLOOR

     The explosion, like a firestorm, rips across the floor:

     BLOWING OUT THE MACHINE GUN NEST AND JAMES AND ALEXANDER

     EXT. AVENUE OF THE STARS

     The police take cover behind their cars.  Powell, Robinson,
     and Mitchell look like they've seen the face of God as the
     building rocks from the blast.  Henry's cigarette falls from
     his mouth as a desk is sent hurtling across Avenue of the

     The hostages are shaken and the terrorists guarding them

               operation since the Bride of

     INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE

     Still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:

                           POWELL'S VOICE
               Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?

     INTERCUT:

     ON POWELL

     Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.

                           POWELL
               Hey, I love you.
                    (looking around)
               So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in
               there, man.  Hang in there.

                           MCCLANE
                    (tired, touched)
               Thanks...partner.

     TV - CLOSE

     As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set.

                           GAIL
                    (as the picture
                    stabilizes)
               ...of the Nakatomi building, sources
               say that the terrorist leader 'Hans'
               may be this man, Hans Gruber.

     A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the
     CAMERA PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR,
     and Hans has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".
     He smiles modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air
     shot, returns to the office.

                           GAIL (CONT'D)
                    (on TV)
               A member of the radical West German
               Volksfrei movement.  Strangely, the
               Volksfrei leadership issued a
               communique an hour ago stating that
               Gruber has been expelled from the
               organization and is operating on his
               own.

                           HARVEY
                    (on TV)
               Obviously, Gail whatever his
               affiliation, it's safe to say that
               Gruber's terrorist actions in Los
               Angeles tonight are well,
               terroristic...

     As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards
     the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here,
     Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.

                           HOLLY
               Where are you going?

                           ELLIS
               I'm tired of sitting here waiting to
               see who gets us killed first...
               them...or your husband.
                    (to the approaching
                    Fritz)
               Hi there.

                           HOLLY
                    (worried)
               What are you going to do?

                           ELLIS
               Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals
               for breakfast.  I can handle these
               clowns.
                    (to Fritz)
               I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!
               Sprickenzie talk?

     He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly
     worries.

     THE OFFICE

                           HANS
               If you'd listened to me he would be
               neutralized already!

               I don't want neutral...I want dead --

     ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.

     AS FRITZ SHRUGS:

                           ELLIS
               It's not what I want, it's what I
               can give you.  Look, let's be
               straight, okay?  It's obvious you're
               not some dumb thug up here to snatch
               a few purses, am I right?

     Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me
     plug this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of
     curious or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.

                           HANS
                    (politely)
               You're very perceptive.

                           ELLIS
                    (flattered)
               Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60
               Minutes, I say to myself, these guys
               are professionals, they're motivated,
               they're happening.  They want
               something.  Now, personally, I don't
               care about your politics.  Maybe
               you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys,
               maybe it's the Hebes, Northern
               Ireland, that's none of my business.
               I figure, You're here to negotiate,
               am I right?

                           HANS
               You're amazing.  You figured this
               all out already?

                           ELLIS
               Hey, business is business.  You use
               a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's
               the difference?  To put it in my
               terms, you're here on a hostile
               takeover and you grab us for some
               greenmail but you didn't expect a
               poison pill was gonna be running
               around the building.
                    (smiling)
               Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.

                           HANS
                    (dryly)
               I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What
               are you saying?

                           ELLIS
               The guy upstairs who's fucking things
               up?  I can give him to you.

     As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:

                                                          CUT TO:

     POWELL

     By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.

                           POWELL
               Roy!  You all right?

     INSIDE - MCCLANE

     He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package
     of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.

                           MCCLANE
               Yeah, just trying to handle some
               year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do
               they put in these things?

                           POWELL
                    (reciting)
               'Sugar, enriched flour, partially
               hydrogenated vegetable oil,
               polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'

                           MCCLANE
                    (laughing)
               You sound like a man with a couple
               of kids.

                           POWELL
               Not yet, the wife in working on our
               first.  You got any kids back on the
               ranch?

     McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,
     flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids
     in happier days.

                           MCCLANE
               Two.  And I'd sure like to see them
               swinging on the jungle gym with Al
               junior.

                           POWELL
               It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.

     McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another
     VOICE besides Powell's comes over his radio.

                           HANS' VOICE
                    (o.s., on CB)
               Touching, cowboy, touching.
                    (pause)
               Or should I call you Mister McClane?
               Mister officer John McClane of the
               NYPD?

     McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

     INTERCUT:

     MCCLANE AND HANS

                           MCCLANE
                    (fighting to stay
                    calm)
               Sister Teresa in third grade called
               me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me
               John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.

                           HANS' VOICE
               I have someone who wants to talk to
               you.  A very special friend who was
               at the party with you tonight.

     McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for
     the voice that tells him it's all over.

                           ELLIS' VOICE
               Hello, John boy?

     McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

     In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives
     him the CB.

                           MCCLANE
               Ellis?

     Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet
     coke.

                           ELLIS
               John, they're giving me a few minutes
               to try and talk some sense into you.
               I know you think you're doing your
               job, and I can appreciate that, but
               you're just dragging this thing out.
               None of us gets out of here until
               these people can negotiate with the
               LA police, and they're just not gonna
               start doing that until you stop
               messing up the works.

                           MCCLANE
                    (carefully)
               Ellis, what have you told them?

                           ELLIS
               I told them we're old friends and
               you were my guest at the party.

     McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows
     his eyes.

                           MCCLANE
               Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...

                           ELLIS
               Tell me about it.

     He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.

                           ELLIS (CONT'D)
               All right...John, listen to me...
               They want you to tell them where the
               detonators are.  They know people
               are listening.  They want the
               detonators or they're going to kill
               me.

     Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.

     INT. POLICE TRAILER - ON POWELL, ROBINSON - SAME

     and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and
     leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen,
     even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.

                           ELLIS' VOICE
               John, didn't you hear me?

                           MCCLANE
                    (to CB, quietly)
               Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!

                           ELLIS
               John, I think you could get with the
               program a little.  The police are
               here now.  It's their problem.
               Tell these guys where the detonators
               are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey,
               I'm putting my life on the line for
               you buddy...

                           MCCLANE
               Don't you think I know that!  Put
               Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that
               shithead doesn't know what kind of
               scum you are, but I do --

                           HANS
               Good.  Then you'll give us what we
               want and save your friend's life.
               You're not part of this equation.
               It's time to realize that.

     Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis,
     smiling.  Ellis smiles, too.

                           ELLIS
               What am I, a method actor?  Hans,
               babe, put away the gun.  This is
               radio, not television...

                           MCCLANE
               That asshole's not my friend!  barely
               know him!  I hate his fucking guts --
                    (desperately sincere)
               -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell
               him you don't mean shit to me --

                           ELLIS
               John, how can you say that, after
               all these years--?  John?  John?

     Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well, I tried..." Hans nods
     understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button,
     and in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up
     to Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER.

     Powell fends off Robinson, who wants the CB.

                           ROBINSON
               Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He
               practically pulled the Goddamned
               trigger himself -- he gave that man
               to them --

                           POWELL
               Christ, can't you read between the
               lines!  He did everything he could
               to save him...if he gave himself up
               they'd both be dead!

                           ROBINSON
               Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be
               talking to us!  Now tell your
               'partner' to stay out of it, or so
               help me if he lives through this
               I'll put him behind bars myself!

     NEW ANGLE

     A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.

     The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-
     boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,
     looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:

               You want to stay alive, keep moving.

                    (nodding)
               He may be a cop... we're checking on
               that --

                           BIG JOHNSON
               One of yours?

                           ROBINSON
                    (too quickly)
               No, sir.

                           BIG JOHNSON
                    (after a moment)
               If he's not a terrorist, and he's
               not a hostage...he's just not part
               of the equation.

     They start to walk away.

                           POWELL
                    (indignant)
               T...that's the same Goddamn thing
               the terrorists said!

                           LITTLE JOHNSON
                    (interested)
               Really?
                    (to Big Johnson)
               That's one good thing.  Sound like
               we're dealing with pros.

     They leave.

     THE COMPUTER

     McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous
     wreck."

                           HANS
                    (nodding)
               There was a party -- celebration --
               all of a sudden they were there --
               shooting -- threatening us --

     CLOSER SHOT

     McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to
     pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.

                           MCCLANE
               Relax, man...you smoke?

     Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils
     of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers
     the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to
     share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and
     Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.

                           HANS
               You...you don't work for Nakatomi...
               and if you're not one of them...

                           MCCLANE
               I'm a cop from New York.

                           HANS
                    (puzzled)
               New York...

                           MCCLANE
                    (explaining)
               They invited me to the Xmas party.
               Who knew?

     Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               Better than being caught with your
               pants down, right?
                    (extending his hand)
               John McClane.

                           HANS
                    (shaking hands)
               William Clay.
                    (smiling)
               Call me Bill.

     McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually
     over at:

     THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES

     In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":
     CAMPBELL,S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.

     BACK TO SCENE

                           MCCLANE
               Bill, you know how to use a handgun?

                           HANS
                    (hesitant)
               One weekend I went to a combat
               ranch...
                    (apologetic)
               You know, that game with the, the
               guns that shoot red paint?  Must
               sound pretty silly to you...

                           MCCLANE
               Sounds better than nothing.

     McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams
     in a fresh one and hands it to him.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               Time for the real thing.

     McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to
     a CLICK.  He slowly turns:

     NEW ANGLE

     Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He
     holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly
     into his radio in German.

                           HANS
               Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come
               quickly.
                    (to McClane)
               Put down your gun and give me my
               detonators.

     McClane just looks at him.

                           MCCLANE
               Hans.  You're Hans.

                    (nods, indicating
                    McClane's gun again)
               Put it down now.

                           MCCLANE
               That was tricky, with the accent.
               I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.
               Why do you need the detonators, Hans?
               I already used the explosives.

                           HANS
               I'm going to count to three...

                           MCCLANE
                    (cold)
               Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.

     McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS
     THE TRIGGER.  Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.
     McClane steps in carefully, reclaims his pistol.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               You think I'm a shmuck, Hans.

     Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.

                           HANS
               You were saying.

     MCCLANE WHIRLS IN TIME TO SEE:

     KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ

     Coming out of it, FIRING.

     BACK TO SCENE

     McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take
     cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back
     at:

     WHERE HANS WAS

     He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his
     passing.

     BACK TO SCENE

     McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:

     BANK OF COMPUTERS

     Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all
     around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:

     FRANCO

     McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk,
     his weapon FLYING:

     CLOSER

     He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his
     head.

     Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:

     MCCLANE

     hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face
     suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.

     HE TURNS:

     HANS

     has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.

     MCCLANE

     FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of
     his shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near
     Hans, who escapes with only superficial scratches.

     HANS

     looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to
     Karl in German:

                           HANS
               The glass!  Shoot the glass!

     And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.

     MCCLANE

     as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes
     it.

     BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS
     on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their
     BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big
     CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a
     million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.

     McClane reaches the end of the counter, DIVES and rolls to
     the floor:

     HIS FOOT

     goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:

     STAIRWELL DOOR

     He's out, gone, safe!

     BACK TO SCENE

     Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through
     rubble, then comes over, smiling.

     He's holding the bag of detonators.

                           HANS
               Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

     Eddie and Uli are guarding the hostages.  Hans and Karl
     return.

     Hans tosses the bag of detonators to Uli, who grins, leaves.

     HOLLY AND GINNY

     Holly has watched all this nervously.  But Ginny's eyes follow
     Karl, who doesn't share the mood of the others.

     Theo and Kristoff REACT, delighted, as they get the message
     SIXTH LOCK DEACTIVATED.  Suddenly a BUZZER SOUNDS and the
     graphic flashes:  "ELECTROMAGNETIC SEAL ENGAGED.  CANNOT BE

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Wincing in pain, McClane washes his foot in a sink basin.
     He washes a deep cut, soaps it, but the pain doesn't relent.

     When a VOICE speaks, he JUMPS, realizes it's the CB.

               Yeah.  But all things being equal,
               I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By
               the way, chalk up two more terrorists.

     INTERCUT:

     POWELL - OUTSIDE

                           POWELL
               They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool
               going on you.

     McClane tries to wrap paper towels on the foot but his grimace
     shows that is still hurts like hell.

                           MCCLANE
                    (through his teeth)
               Yeah?  What's the odds?

                           POWELL
               You don't want to know.

     Suddenly remembering an NYPD course in first aid from ten
     years ago, McClane removes the improvised bandage, check the
     cut more carefully.

                           MCCLANE
                    (as he work)
               Put me down for twenty anyway...I'm
               good for it...so, what got you off
               the street, Al?  You liked lousy
               coffee, or what?

     Powell doesn't answer right away.  At the same time, McClane
     swallows, seeing a gleam inside his foot.  He gingerly probes,
     and pulls out a shard of glass almost three inches long from
     its angled gash, his mouth twisted in a silent scream all
     the way.

                           POWELL'S VOICE
               I...realized I couldn't do what I
               had to anymore...at least not out
               there.  I had an...accident.

     McClane throws the glass across the room, forehead bathed in
     sweat.

                    (beat, serious)
               I...I shot a kid.

     Realizing what he's hearing for the first time, McClane's
     face shifts to a new kind of pain.

                           POWELL (CONT'D)
                    (soft)
               Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark...

               gun he had looked real enough...yeah,
               I had all the right excuses...but
               afterwards...  I really couldn't
               draw my gun again.

                           MCCLANE
               I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to
               make a joke of it.

                           MCCLANE
               I still feel like shit.

                           POWELL
               Then this won't matter.
                    (reluctantly)
               LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.

     AND AS MCCLANE REACTS WE GO TO:

     INT. VAULT ROOM - NIGHT

     Hans and Theo lean over a monitor watching a DWP truck near

               There's the city engineers...they're
               going into the street circuits...But
               who are these guys in the suits?

                           HANS
               That's the FBI...ordering them to
               cut the building's power.  They're
               as regular as clockwork...or a time
               lock...

     ON THEO'S LOOK:

                           HANS (CONT'D)
               ...the circuits that cannot be cut...
               are cut automatically in response to
               a terrorist incident...You ask for
               miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...

                           THEO
               When you're hot, you're hot.

                                                         CUT TO:*

     EXT. BUILDING

     As we saw on Theo's screen, the Johnsons and Robinson and
     Powell are my a MANHOLE with a CITY ENGINEER.  A big CONTROL
     BOX is there, cables snaking into the ground where another
     CITY WORKER finishes WELDING a last connection.

                           GUY IN MANHOLE
               We're spliced in down the line.

                           LITTLE JOHNSON
               Do it...now.

     The engineer THROWS GIANT LEVERS.  Inside the manhole, SPARKS
     SIZZLE and massive contacts CLUNK.

     THE BUILDING

     One by one, all the light on all the floors GO OUT.

     MCCLANE

     in the bathroom, ripping off his shirt and tying it around
     his foot, he REACTS --

                           MCCLANE
                    (into CB)
               Powell?  What's going on?

     INTERCUT:

     OUTSIDE

                           POWELL
                    (watching the others)
               Ask the FBI.  They've got the
               terrorist playbook and they're running
               it, step by step.

     McClane reacts, worried; he knows better.

     THE HOSTAGES

     GROAN WITH THIS NEW PROBLEM:

     THE VAULT ROOM

     Theo and Kristoff and Hans huddle over the computer monitor
     screen as if it was a warm fireplace.  Theo points to the
     computer screen; all they can do is wait.  We HEAR the HUMM
     of a portable generator.  The lights go OFF.  The computer
     screen stays ON.  Theo looks over at the safe.

     SAFE LED READOUT

     It still reads "FIBER OPTIC TIME LOCK CANNOT BE DISARMED AT
     THIS LOCATION.  TERMINATE SEQUENCE (Y/N)?"

     BACK TO SCENE

                           KRISTOFF
               Damn!  It didn't go!

                           THEO
               They're on the building circuit...
               it's too local.

                           HANS
               Encourage them to be bolder.

                           THEO
               The only thing left for them is the
               City Grid...
                    (worried, typing)
               ...They may not do it.

     EXT. BUILDING

     Just as the Johnsons are looking SMUG...all the floors GO
     BACK ON, one by one!

                           LITTLE JOHNSON
               Shit!
                    (turning, to the
                    Engineer)
               Cut it again.  Go wider.

                           ENGINEER
               I can't go wider here...
                    (to Robinson, looking
                    for help)
               ...I'd have to call downtown have
               them take down one of the city

               -- Ten blocks?
                    (to Big Johnson)
               Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve,
               thousands of people -- the Mayor'll
               Scream bloody murder --

                           BIG JOHNSON
                    (ignoring Robinson,
                    to the Engineer)
               We must shut down the building.  Go
               wider --!

                           ENGINEER
               I need authorization --

                           BIG JOHNSON
               Authorization?  How about the United
               States Fucking Government?  Lose the
               grid or lose your job!

     The engineer looks at Robinson.  No help.  The engineer looks
     at his guy in the manhole, shrugs.  No choice.

                           ENGINEER
                    (takes phone)
               Central.  This is Walt, out at
               Nakatomi.  I want you to shut down
               grid 212.
                    (listens)
               No shit, it's my ass.  Just shut it
               down now.

     Pause...pause...AND THEN THE FLOORS OF THE BUILDING ALL GO
     OUT AGAIN.

     IN THE VAULT ROOM

     EMERGENCY LIGHTING FLICKS ON.   An ALARM "beep-beep-beeps."

     THE LED READOUT ON THE SAFE

     Changes to "FIBER OPTIC TIME LOCK DEACTIVATED AT SOURCE.
     SEVENTH LOCK DISENGAGED."

     BACK TO SCENE

     With a dramatic HUM worthy of 2001, the vault door OPEN

     OUTSIDE

     The FBI guys look at the dark building, than at the LAPD
     guys.

                           BIG JOHNSON
               That should shake'em up.  With all
               the power shut down, those bastards
               are probably scared shitless.

     IN THE VAULT ROOM

     The safe door finishes its ponderous move, CLUNKS to a halt.

     Theo and Kristoff LAUGH, give each other high fives.  Even
     Hans loses his usual cool, slaps Theo on the back as Theo
     and Kristoff CHEER.

     THORNBURG'S TV TRUCK

     drives along a residential street.  We SEE the Nakatomi tower
     in the b.g., spotlit by the police beams.  Thornburg checks
     a map, POINTS a turn out to the driver.

                                                          CUT TO:

     OUTSIDE THE NAKATOMI BUILDING

     Powell looks up at the dark structure lit only by emergency
     lighting.  He sidles over to the FBI men.

                           POWELL
                    (dryly)
               What do we do now, arrest them for
               not paying their electric bill?

                           LITTLE JOHNSON
                    (sharply)
               We let them sweat awhile.  Then,

                    (pause)
               ...We give them helicopters...

               Right up the ass.
                    (into another
                    communicator)
               This is Johnson...no the other one.
               I want that air support ready to
               lift off in five minutes...Damn right
               fully armed.  We're on our way.
                    (into CB)
               Attention in the building.

     INTERCUT:

     VAULT ROOM

     Hans talks while Theo and Kristoff tackle the problem of
     unloading the racks and racks of bonds and transferring them
     to the black cases.

                           HANS
               This is Hans...

                           BIG JOHNSON
               This is Agent Johnson of the FBI.
               The State Department has arranged
               for the release of your comrades.
               The helicopters you requested are on
               the way.

               I hear you, FBI.  We'll be ready.

     He disconnects, smiles at Theo.

                           HANS (CONT'D)
               When they touch down and we blow the
               roof, they'll spend a month sifting
               through the bodies and rubble.  By
               the time they figure out what went
               wrong...
                    (smiling at the irony)

               By the time he figures out what hit
               him, he'll be in a body bag.

     The Johnsons exit.  Powell and Robinson look at each other,
     unhappy.  Powell's CB HISSES --

                           MCCLANE'S VOICE

     McClane tries walking on his foot.  He winces in pain, clearly

               for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask
               how, you'll know by then...and tell
               her...tell her...I've been a jerk.
               When things panned out for her, I
               should've been behind her all the
               way ...We had something great going
               until I screwed it up...She was the
               best thing that ever happened to a
               bum like me.  She's heard me say I
               love you a thousand times, but she
               never got to hear this...honey...I'm
               sorry.

                           (PAUSE)

               I got it.  But you can tell her
               yourself.  Just watch your ass and
               you'll make it.

                           MCCLANE
               I hope so.  But that's up to the guy
               upstairs.

     His eyes flick over the area...then he looks up.  Seeing

     with difficulty, he climbs up on a thick pipe, flicks his
     lighter and hold its high.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Explosives are everywhere.

               Oh my God...

               We're both professionals.  But this
               is personal.  You...are done.

     WHAM!  McClane DRIVES his elbow into Karl's face.

     NEW ANGLE

     Karl's weapon clatters on the floor.  McClane follows his
     first blow with another.  Karl recovers, and with a spinning
     karate kick SLAMS McClane back.

                           EDDIE
               They're coming.

     CAMERA PANS across the room to the doorway of the office,
     where Hans nods, stands.

                           THORNBURG'S VOICE
                    (FROM TV)
               -- I know you're proud of your
               daddy...

     CLOSEUP - HOLLY

     She's speechless, watching in shock as:

     THE PORTABLE TV

     shows Thornburg at Holly's house!  He's squatting down with
     his microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.
     His voice is soft, comforting.

                           THORNBURG
                    (to the children)
               ...because he's a very brave
               policeman.  And your mom has shown
               just as much courage.  But is there
               something you would like to say to
               them if they're watching?

     John Jr. says nothing, but Lucy looks at the camera.

                           LUCY
               Come home.

     HOLLY

     She struggles to stay composed...can't.  She slowly turns
     her head, looks at Hans.

     HER P.O.V. - HANS

     He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on
     her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles.

                           HANS
               Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your
               acquaintance.

     He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,
     making everyone jump!

               You'll lock them up there and come
               right down...

     Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the
     stairs.

     Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.

     THE MACHINE FLOOR

     McClane and Karl move towards each other, each sizing the
     other up, each looking over the terrain.

                           MCCLANE
               Better this way, isn't it?  I mean,
               any faggot can shoot a gun.

     This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he does
     charge, it's unexpected.

     The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial
     training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the
     street.

               You should've heard your brother

               neck...

     Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists
     free, slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off,
     circles McClane with new respect.

               terrorists, and lose 20 percent of
               the hostages...  25, tops.

                           LITTLE JOHNSON
               I can live with those numbers.

     Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last
     few out.

     They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash

     opinion.

     HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF

     They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly
     copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to
     himself, moves towards the door:

     VAULT ROOM

     Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out
     of the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others
     continue.

                    (to Hans, scornfully)
               After all your posturing, all your
               speeches...you're nothing but a common
               thief.

               I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs.
               McClane.  And now that I'm moving up

               polite.

     Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another
     one.

     McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then
     Karl charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his
     legs upwards, propelling Karl into the air:

     The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the
     door, OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking
     Baretta in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has
     even stopped twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM,
     McClane snatches up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the
     roof.  He charges through the crowd, spots Ginny near the
     edge of the roof.  She meets him halfway.

     And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the
     door as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the
     roof.

     McClane herds the last of the hostages inside, starts for
     the door himself, when with a ROAR and a CHATTER of rotors,
     the lead chopper zooms overhead!  McClane throws himself
     down on the ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight
     turn and then from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked,
     McClane DIVES out of the way of the bullets that stitch across
     the door.

     HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)

     McClane DIVES away from another burst.

                           MCCLANE
               You assholes, I'm on your side -- !

     They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around,
     see a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING
     UP behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose,
     unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his
     legs.

     He looks over the edge, hesitates:

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               Fuck this...

     Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS:

     THE VAULT ROOM

     Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button.

     LONG SHOT - THE ROOF

     The helipad EXPLODES!  A FIREBALL rolls into the sky.

     THE HOSTAGES

     lose their footing on the floor.  Dust and debris fall down,
     but they're okay.

     JOHNSON AND JOHNSON'S CHOPPER

     STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT
     in the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it
     CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building!

     MCCLANE

     Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces
     as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him.

     THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE

     Flame ROARS TOWARDS it, engulfs it.  It JERKS on its
     foundation PIVOTS 180 degrees as several bolts slip:

     MCCLANE

     DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against
     the side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.
     The shatterproof glass doesn't budge!

     Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS sizzles by, McClane levels
     the machine gun, KICKS off from the building, SWINGS back
     ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his arc -- FIRES the gun
     and sails back in:

     INSIDE THE BUILDING

     McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside,
     rolls onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.
     Finally he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to
     one knee:

     UP ON THE ROOF

     The fire hose mounting is BLASTED off the roof, SAILS past
     the CAMERA:

     OUTSIDE THE BUILDING

     The hose mechanism tumbles downward!

     INSIDE

     McClane is YANKED off his feet, dragged towards the window!

     THE HOSE WHEEL - OUTSIDE

     It SLIDES down the side of the building!  The hose PLAYS OUT
     on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his
     death!

     MCCLANE

     CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered
     window, he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he
     fights the weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.
     Only his already wounded foot keeps him indoors.

     He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets
     free just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the
     great beyond!

     Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in
     time for:

     THE ROOF

     to RECOIL from another staggering explosion!

     THEY SCREAM, CRY OUT:

     IN THE VAULT ROOM

     As Holly covers her head from falling plaster, the men work
     like automatons, piling up the bonds.

     MCCLANE

     recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is
     momentarily amazed to HEAR a "ding" from the elevator -- he
     looks at:

     THE SHAFT

     where suddenly the WALL EXPLODES OUTWARD as an ENTIRE ELEVATOR
     CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL, swinging on its cable like a
     demolition ball on a crane!

     BACK TO SCENE

     McClane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head
     like schrapnel:

     THE ELEVATOR

     reaches the apex of its swing, drops down in an arcing turn:

     WIDE SHOT

     the elevator CRASHES into the stairs!  The section McClane
     in on SNAPS LOOSE!  At the last minute McClane LEAPS towards:

     THE VAULT FLOOR BALCONY

     and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and
     beneath him!  With his last effort, he hauls himself onto
     the balcony and them moves off!

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. BUILDING

     The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson
     are open-mouthed.

     IN THE BASEMENT

     Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the
     stuffed animal held over his head as much for company as
     protection.

     As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from
     under the fur...and sees:

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     HIS P.O.V. - THEO

     at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's
     jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the
     truck away from the loading dock.

     MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR

     He creeps forward, looks carefully into:

     HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM

     They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.
     Suddenly the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.

     BACK TO SCENE

     McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he
     took from Uli.  One bullet!

                           MCCLANE
                    (under his breath)
               Shit...

     He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

     Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it
     to the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really
     worried.

     Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on
     a tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:

     IN THE BASEMENT

     Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into
     the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.

     ARGYLE

     Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.

     THE GARAGE                                        382

     A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier
     delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into the
     van, which CAREENS into the wall.

     CLOSER

     Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one
     punch.

                           ARGYLE
                    (looking around)
               Where's the camera when you need
               them?

                                                          CUT TO:

     THE VAULT ROOM

                           HANS
               Let's move.

     The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly
     while Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff
     goes to the door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD
     COCKED by a rifle butt.

     WIDER

     McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks
     still tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine
     gun ready.

                           MCCLANE
               Hans!

     Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly
     into view.  No words need be said.

                           HOLLY
               John!

                           MCCLANE
               Holly, we have to stop meeting like
               this.
                    (taking in the vault)
               So that's what it was.  A fucking
               robbery.
                    (thinking)
               So why nuke the building, Hans?

                           HANS
                    (with a shrug)
               When you steal six hundred dollars,
               you can disappear...but when you
               steal six hundred million, they will
               find you...unless you play dead.
                    (tight smile)
               Which happens to be your next role...
               drop your gun, please.

     McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,
     really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.

                           HANS (CONT'D)
                    (to Eddie)
               Nein, dies ein ist mein.
                    (to McClane)
               This time John Wayne does not walk
               off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

                           MCCLANE
               That was Gary Cooper, shithead...

                           HANS
               No more jokes, drop it or she gets
               it between the eyes!

                           MCCLANE
                    (slowly putting down
                    his gun)
               Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?

                           HANS
               'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now
               you are fucked.

     HE AIMS:

                           MCCLANE
               Holly, now...!

     Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!

     MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT

     At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta
     from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS
     Hans high in the chest!

     The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind
     him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is
     happening, McClane SPINS:

     EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS

     Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood
     in shock.

     MCCLANE

                           MCCLANE
               You were right about us Americans.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
                    (he blows smoke from
                    his pistol barrel)
               We are cowboys.

     VAULT ROOM - WIDER

     Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and
     disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts
     to TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward
     place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:

     HOLLY'S WRIST

     and she is YANKED off her feet!

     BACK TO SCENE

     Ans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane
     LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the
     last minute!

     EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT

     The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the
     window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto
     Holly as Hans drags her out!

     McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains
     to pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill
     with her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand,
     begins to INCH towards Holly's wristband.

     HANS' HAND - WIDEN

     A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood
     flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand
     to bring up the gun he is still holding!

     MCCLANE

     Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one
     last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:

     VERY CLOSE

     McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed
     metal SNAPS, links flying:

     WIDER

     Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch
     suddenly drop.

     We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him
     HIT.

     McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.

                           MCCLANE
               It's okay, babe.  It's okay.

     He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of
     wristband he's still holding.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               You got a warranty on this?

     She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BUILDING - DAWN

     Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.

     Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.

     CLOSER

     A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.  We
     SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by
     SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane
     breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes
     into the crowd.

                           MCCLANE
                    (calling out)
               Al?  Al, you here -- ?

     The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and
     McClane knows it's him.  They stare at each other, ten feet
     apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.
     But somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each
     other like men who've lived through combat together...which,
     in fact, is the truth.

                           MCCLANE (CONT'D)
                    (emotional)
               Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I
               couldn't have made it without you.

                           POWELL
               Bullshit.

                           MCCLANE
               I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife...
               Holly Gennero.

                           HOLLY
                    (taking Powell's hand,
                    correcting)
               Holly McClane.

     Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.

                           POWELL
                    (to her)
               A pleasure.  I guess John doesn't
               need me to give you that message
               anymore.

                           HOLLY
                    (puzzled)
               Message?

     McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's
     direction.

                           POWELL
               You know, about him being such a
               jerk -- and how he's really sor --
                    (seeing McClane)
               -- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill you
               in.

     Just then Robinson barges forward.

                           ROBINSON
               I want you for debrief, McClane.
               You've got some things to answer for --
               Ellis' murder -- property damage --
               interfering with police* business --

     A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.

     HIS P.O.V.

     There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.

     Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his
     machine gun.

     EXT. BUILDING

     As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with
     McClane and levels his gun.  McClane throws Holly to the
     ground and grabs the dumbstruck Robinson's sidearm.

     But he doesn't get off a shot -- a lone gunshot stops Karl --

     knocking him back through the doorway.  McClane looks back
     to see Powell still sighting down the barrel of his .38.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     His hand is rock steady.  He sees McClane's look.

                           POWELL
                    (shrugging)
               You were right.  You couldn't have
               made it without me.

     They smile.  Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan
     onto them.  Thornburg pushes his way forward, mike extended
     like a weapon.

                           THORNBURG
               Mr. McClane... Mrs. McClane...any
               comment on your incredible ordeal?
               What are your feelings now that it's
               all over?

     Without a beat, Holly PUNCHES HIM in the chops.  He FALLS,
     dropping the mike with an electronic SQUEAL.  McClane looks
     at his wife, amazed.  Behind them, Thornburg sits on the
     ground, nurses his lip, turns to his camerman.

                           THORNBURG (CONT'D)
                    (Eager)
               Did you get that?

     McClane and Holly continue on, turn towards:

     ARGYLE'S LIMO

     It's a little smashed up, but still running.  Argyle is
     standing beside the open door.  McClane and Holly get in and
     Argyle closes the door.

                           ARGYLE
                    (getting in the front)
               If this is their idea of Christmas I
               gotta be there for New Year's.

     CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW the rear window where McClane and
     Holly are kissing.  As they drive off, we:

                                                         FADE OUT

                               THE END
